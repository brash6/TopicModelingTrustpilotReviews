2020-10-31T10:21:40Z	Expensive ride& poor customer service experience	I travelled from Swindon to London Paddington my ticket was checked twice during the journey which I felt was unnecessary. You have barriers to enter to the train station and when you exit so what’s the point of checking ticket in the train? Also after work yesterday there was delay in the train back to Swindon which was not explained. Such a poor service and with expensive travelling. And no refunds issued on tickets if you make an error on our booking.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

Checked on the app for first train for the journey for 5:21am on Sunday but when arrived at the station the train time just changed to 6:21 ,,, what a f--king joke!!!

2020-10-31T10:21:40Z	Where do I start	Where do I start, After a long two hour wait in the freezing cold weather, I ended up being let down bye a national express coach that didn’t turn up. I decided the only option I had was to get on a train. I suffer from a mild mental illness and I had trouble getting a ticket sorted via my mobile phone. when I arrived on the platform I was very cold and distressed. I approached a woman sitting on a bench I believed to be the normal paying customer just waiting for the same train I needed, She told me not to worry and that I could buy a ticket once I was on it. It was the National rail on the 25th September 7:45pm departure from Nottingham station to London st pancreas, as it turns out she was actually the hostess/driver I think? She put me on the EMR first class. When I was seated She got me a cup of tea and a bottle of water that I didn’t have to pay for, Her name was Sally Mac. I can’t thank you enough lovely for your help and support and also for your first class professionalism and kindness towards me. I am very great full for everything you did for me and so glad it was you that i approached. It didn’t stop there, As Sally Had spoken to the ticket man Robert mail about my situation, He decided not to charge me for my journey. I was speechless and could not believe my luck. You guys are the best and I wanted national rail to know how lucky they are to have such amazing staff like the both of you. Again I can’t thank you enough from the bottom of my heart and will definitely be using this service from now on in the near future. Kind regards.

2020-10-31T10:21:40Z	Cyclists Treated Like Muck	This isn't the first time that I have been shouted at (told off) like a piece of dirt by railway staff. I've committed such crimes as rolling up to the ENTRANCE of Reading station, and putting my ticket into the machine while I still have a leg over the bike (because why take time to dismount when you are 1. Not even in the station yet, 2. Have a queue of people building up behind you and 3. You're about to pass through a narrow ticket gate, standing beside the bike is just impractical and awkward! Been shouted at by a rude bald masked staff member at Reading station entrance, hopefully he annoys the wrong cyclist one day and finds out what we all think of him! Just to note, in my 20 odd years of cycling I've never injured anyone except myself. I think I am capable of scooting through a gate, hardly riding down the escalators now is it?!I've also committed such crimes as waiting for my morning train to work and daring to take my bike onto a section of the train which is not labelled for bicycles. Well, 1. There ain't many of us so what's the big deal, 2. There isn't even always a cycling carriage, 3. There often isn't space for bikes if there is more than 1 bicycle boarding and 4. How am I supposed to know when waiting for a train where the cycling carriage is going to stop. It could end up stopping down the other end of the platform from where I waited and as shown above its a crime of the highest magnitude to cycle down to the carriage so I have before chosen to stand with my bike, out of the way, in a regular carriage and been spoken to like dirt. No wonder no-one wants to take the train unless they absolutely have to. Way to kill off your business even quicker	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

2020-10-31T10:21:40Z	Horrible website	ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING  I cannot believe British Rail. Due to mental health reasons my daughter went on the web site to book a rail ticket to come up and stay with me' her mother.  The site let her on and allowed her to book a ticket and she paid her money which was accepted, A few days later she received a text to say the train had been cancelled.  She received another text today to say she is unable to get her money back as she should not have booked knowing the situation. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!  Why allow her to book the ticket'  why allow her to pay the money. A really poor way to make money British Rail especially when money is so precious due to job losses and no work	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1
2020-10-31T10:21:40Z	ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING	National Rail has rightly earned the reputation of Worst Customer Service in the country in my opinion.An elderly  friend was brought home to Scotland from Spain on a Rescue Flight and self isolated 14 days.His return Rail Ticket was from Kings Cross London. Obviously as he was brought directly to Scotlandhe had to buy another ticket to return from Glasgow.When he requested refund for ticket,  initially they refused. He explained the situation, was then asked for copy of ticket plus bank details etc.He is not familiar with internet so I took a picture of the ticket and sent them the bank details.They responded saying the ticket was not clear enough! They couldn't see the price.It is an extremely clear picture, but, in fact, even on the original ticket the price is very small.It wouldn't take a genius to check the ticket against the bank payment.I have sent them another 7 pics at 7 different angles so here's hoping common sense steps in!Pay the pensioner his money back for God's sake.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1
2020-10-31T10:21:40Z	National Rail Worst Customer Service in the Country!	Please please please I advise anyone reading this review do not I repeat do not make the mistake of purchasing a annual pass through network rail!!!. Sadly I made a huge mistake of purchasing a annual train pass In June 2019 for £897 to which I make a monthly payment to my company of £74.00 a month, Due to the cov-19 I have no other option than to work from home, so thought as I have 3 months remaining on my pass it would be wise to freeze my pass until I can travel again. I was told by the staff member that I could not freeze my pass but for the 3 remaining months left I could receive a partial repayment. At that point I expected to recieve a difference of £214 however was told that how they work out the difference It would mean that I'd get back £36.00. When I asked how they worked this out they could not explain, yet what is more frustrating is that  a number of my colleagues who purchased a swift card have managed to freeze their rail passes due to the coronavirus incident. I am absolutely appalled that National rail have nothing in place like all other companies to support there customers and offer such ridiculous partial repayments this makes no sense and is clearly day light robbery!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1
2020-10-31T10:21:40Z	The disappointment of this rail company!!	The national rail website is horrendously bad. It crashes almost everytime I go on it and from multiple devices so it's not just me.As a frequent train traveller, it has been this way for years-why haven't they fixed it?Train prices are also abysmal for the amount of delays and cancellations you get. I would say I get delays of more than 15 mins on 75-80% of my journeys. How are the prices higher than any other country and the service so much worse?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

Birmingham New Street to Wolverhampton train on Saturday night delayed over 15 minutes and when it does arrive only 3 carriages for probably 3 times the amount of people. Apparently the Wolverhampton/Birmingham line is nearly always like this whether it be day or night. Why is our train service so bad when other countries seem to manage to run a good public transport service.  Someone needs to get it sorted, just not good enough I'm afraid. Sending 3 carriages on a busy Saturday night is just unacceptable.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

2020-02-15T08:42:28Z	Absolute joke!!	I get the train every morning from Bearsted to Barming and the same back later in the day, Monday to friday; and Saturday's. Every morning without fail the trains either late, not running or leaves earlier than the website time that it's due. Every afternoon without fail it's either delayed or cancelled with little to no explanation as to why. It's an absolute joke now! Last week I had to walk home after the website and app still saying the trains were running, but when I get to station they're cancelled, took me 3 and a half hours as I had already bought my train ticket and didn't have the £30 cab fair it costs to get me home. People rely on this service, pay for this service and dont get the service we should. Hardly ever any working toilets... like today, I've had to wait around 2 hours for the next working train just now, and couldn't even go toilet like I needed during that time because ticket office bit not open. Sort it out. This has been happening daily since at least 4th February 2019 when I started my job. I'm now late to work nearly everyday, so losing money, and my work are now shocked if I'm there on time, your services are risking my job being looked at because of it. Well done on a great job, not. Oh and not even replacement buses from either of these stops! If I give 0 star I would... unfortunately you get away with everything because people need public transport.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

They regularly run replacement bus services due to work on the tracks over weekends which has been going on for a year but unfortunately they are either late or even worse they leave 5-10mins early so your stood there for 40mins waiting for a bus that’s already left. They amount of times I’ve finished work and been heading to station only to see the bus I’m supposed to be getting on driving off 10mins before it’s supposed too. Terrible customer service and lack of care is what comes to mind when I think of national rail.

2020-02-15T08:42:28Z	Just traveled to Glasgow from Larbert…	The uk rail system is just too unreliable and expensive. It has from my experience got worse over the last year with issues on approximately 5-20% of journeys, and seem to spend all my time claiming money back from delayed journeys. Last 2 journeys to London  with EMR had issues, with the first journey ending up with trains terminating early both ways which meant I got all my money back, last journey train late by 45 minutes so half money back. And recently did a number of journeys with Northern and 2 journeys cancelled at short notice with a one hour delay. A further delayed journey on LNER required a diversion which added 2 hours. The problem is that no common reason for delays, some times train breaks down, other time other trains break down and block line, sometimes point failures or overhead cables issues. Although you can trace most of the issues down to poor maintenance and lack of capacity.When it works rail system is fine, and although standard tickets are horrendously expensive, there are some really cheap advanced fares and promotional tickets	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	5

2019-09-26T20:02:49Z	Daylight robbery | what a joke	Daylight Robbery | What a jokeThe train service is unreliable and costs a fortune! Without a doubt, everyday my train is 15-30 minutes delayed. The train hasn't come on time for weeks. Approximately 3-4 times a month it is cancelled, the consequences of this is being late for work and having to pay additional money for taxis or other services. The worst part about this is that the rail service provide absolutely no refund when the train is cancelled. I have to pay for a service that I do not receive.Last week I bought a 16-25 railcard for the price of £30. Only to find out that it wont save me any money on season tickets and only knocks off £1 on daily tickets, (definently not 1/3 as advertised).You cant use it anytime before 10:00 AM in the morning, this is pointless because everyone tends to start work before this time. The ticket was refused a refund, despite the card not actually being used yet. It's a pure scam to get more money out of you.I'm a student on minimum apprenticeship wage. It takes 16 hours of work to pay the train for the week. An expensive £47 for 4 small journeys! The rail service is an absolute joke and their only purpose is to provide you with a terrible on-train experience for an absolute ridiculous price.I do not recommend to anyone - they are stealing from me daily.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

However, to my surprise, not only did the staffs at office refused to help, they were very rude! I had no idea just how behind national rail’s system is, it is so bad they cannot locate a customers purchase from receipt and confirmation details...

In fact I lived in Wiltshire, Hertfordshire and Hampshire and it is nearly equally bad everywhere. On 28-07-2019 trains from St Pancras to Luton got cancelled and we were told to get off in Kentish Town. No replacement bus service from that station, station personnel pointed us in the direction of the bus stop and said that C11 bus from there would take us to the West Hampstead station where the replacement bus services start from. Turns out there was no C11 bus stopping at that bus station, so we ended up walking for an hour to the West Hampstead station. There were about 70 other people waiting. No replacement buses - they started calling cabs without any queue in place, I felt sorry for the staff, but they were not prepared at all, running around like headless chickens.

Along the platform walks Roy a station employee,  “I am just making a cup of tea, who would like one”?  He served  six cups of tea to  us, the waiting travellers.  (There isn’t a cafe on that side of the station) What a lovely thing to do for complete strangers.   Thank  you. Roy Your bosses should be very proud of you..	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	5

The station Manager was very friendly and efficient and clearly very good at her job. Even at rush hour this station feels orderly. Someone had planted hanging baskets and planters around the station which look beautiful. The little cafe sells delicious tea and a selection of sandwiches, pastries, newspapers etc. All in all a delightful station.

2019-09-26T20:02:49Z	Emily was fantastic!	Hi I would like to write to thank Emily Garsden at Bournemouth train station. I had a very tight schedule travelling for business (I regularly travel from London to Bournemouth with my company Aylesworth Fleming) she went above and beyond to help me. She has only been in the job one day and her customer service and positive, incredibly accommodating attitude was exceptional. She had an Adecco lanyard and I couldn’t help but feel I must inform you of her outstanding work. I also saw her upon my arrival helping other customers. An absolute attribute to national rail.

National Rail is a disgrace, who presumably employ 'the wrong people'  (had to delete original word) to design their web sites.

Only thankful that this time round the train arrived on time...remind me why the fares are so high besides sharing it around your shareholders. Awful serviceI spoke to the ticket officer to find out if there were any updates and I was told one person was going through nine carriages with a trolley (this was at two stops to the end of my journey fyi) he then went on to say that customers are now assuming they will be spoilt with the choice of a buffet. Can I add it was just hot drinks and snacks and ""spoilt"" you pay for those items...this train was finishing in Penzance...it was over five hours to the end of the journey for others and it was marketed as a catered train."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1
2019-07-04T08:52:24Z	On a five hour straight Journey today…	Every time I get on a train I wholly expect that it will be delayed by at least 5 minutes, and I am only surprised if it is over an hour. Today my train departed 6 minutes late and arrived 10 minutes late, a comparatively small time but this meant I missed my connection. The next train wouldn't be for another 20 minutes, meaning I would also miss my next two connections and there would be no way for me to get home to my family for Easter before 8am the following day.I thought about complaining on the East Midlands Trains page but this happens every time I take a train outside of London. Every single service apart from the Thameslink and the Underground is scarily unreliable and shambolically underdeveloped. I find it hard to believe that every train company is a catastrophic sinkhole for our astronomic fares. National Rail has never acted in the best interests of the public, never forced investment in the infrastructure, never done anything to ease the suffering that thousands across the country go through on a daily basis putting up with these nineteenth century levels of service. They see all our negative reviews and charge even more for thier horrible service. A national disgrace.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

2019-07-04T08:52:24Z	National Railway	Needed my railcard renewed, very short on money and I have seen a lot of varying discounts and promotions for money off the £30 discount card, however, none were valid during the time of my card renewal date. Spoke to national rail, they could not provide me with any sort of money off or code for a discount. I am a returning card user. So I bought the card, and received a letter advising that my railcard is about to be expired and it provided a code I can use to receive a reduction. I was quite unhappy as I’m really trying to save where possible, and then to see this come through the post. Spoke to National Rail, they were really sorry but couldn’t help me at all or apply the code. Apparently, refunding the unused card in order to buy a new one with the discount would cost a £5 admin fee, like we don’t pay enough already!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

2019-07-04T08:52:24Z	So horrible service	Why does the national rail service always choose to rob it’s customers?£20 fine for supposedly using an peak/off peak ticket.My anger is that common sense seemed aloof and on top of that the customer assistant who normally presents himself well was having an off day by saying that in issuing me a fine, he is teaching me!Anyways, I purchased a ticket through the Loco2 app, i specified my location and time of travel and was given a list of times, I choose the earliest available train from potters bar to Hatfield and tapped on the return price (£4)! I did this while I was on the train from Finsbury Park station! Given that I have got a TfL student travel card for all zones, I am covered to travel peak & offpeak. Meaning that at the start of my journey on the same train at Finsbury Park station, I was covered, but at the end of it, with the addition of the online travel ticket that I parchesed from Loco2, I was not covered peak/offpeak! I did not know this as when buying the tickets online. I also should not have been fined because by the time I got out of the station I was in the clear, as in it was no longer peak!However, the national rail agent said that my addition to my travel started during peak time even though I explained that it was not applicable at the start of my journey on the same train as I was covered with my student oyster (weekly travel card).To make things worse, the difference between peak and off peak is 0.20p!!Regardless that I proved my argument with all the receipts physical and electronic, the customer service agent was determined to issue me a fine, eventually concluding that even with all my efforts, I did not have a physical copy of my ticket and an electronic copy of my purchased travel was of no use even though he (the customer agent) is the one that eventually printed it out!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

Prices in ONLY the UK are ridiculous.My experience, December 2018. trip from Hockley to oxford street, with tube included, 2 x adult fares off peak (empty train) advance booking, best price was a few pence over £80.  So i used my car, totally non green thing to do, driven by greedy cashcow privitised trains with no proper control by .gov regulator.(gov assisted rip off)Own car- Fuel cost £15, conjestion charge £11.50, NCP car park £18 for the day close to Oxford street. Total £44.50, a saving of £35.50 compared to train. Benefits were - own schedule, no cold platforms, own seats in comfort with heating working !  Downside, journey took a little longer, but we did not have to wait for an off peak train. WHAT AN EARTH IS GOING ON, THIS IS MADNESS CONDONED BY GOVERNMENT TO LET CRONIES GET RICH AND FOREIGN RAIL COMPANIES DRAIN PROFITS TO NON UK Bank accounts avoiding uk taxes. Cronies are also quite stupid to let trains run empty when off peak, in order to make costs even more outrageous for peak time users.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

You pay a LOT of money for a train ticket which for the service I don’t actually understand why. I RARELY make it to work on time, or actually to ANYWHERE that I use a train to get to. Some stations still don’t have ticket machines, and when the gentleman on the train has also run out of tickets and the staff at the other station isn’t helpful AT ALL and ignores you as he is talking  To a friend, you then end up leaving the station and getting a massive fine for not having a ticket although the service was delayed, without access to a ticket machine, yet thats our fault? Dreadful company. Takes months to get a reply when you report anything like the rudeness you receive from staff or horrific service from the actual individual train companies.

2019-01-09T08:15:35Z	Staff are not human	I try to live my life showing kindness and care to everyone. Whilst I do not expect this in return I do hope that people are reasonable in the approach towards other fellow human beings. This is sadly not the case at BOURNEMOUTH TRAIN STATION. my train was at 10.22 and having arrived at the station 8 mins early I asked the ticket guy if I could just get on the train that was in and use my phone app for the ticket. He advised me I had to print my tickets. I did this and approached the doors of the train at 10.21. The doors would not open. At this point a whistle was blown and I was told to move away from the train. I advised the guard SABRINA that my mum was already on the train and asked her to open the doors . She shouted at me NO MOVE AWAY FROM THE TRAIN. I asked again for her to open the door as it was not time for the train to leave. She shouted even louder NO I WILL NOT OPEN THE DOORS MOVE AWAY FROM THE TRAIN. After the train pulled away I was naturally very distressed and upset that no compassion was shown.  I spoke to the guard who explained that there was a 30 second rule and that the train would be late if the doors were re opened. The point here is that the train would have been on time had Sabrina shown a human approach and opened the doors.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

2018-07-11T08:41:10Z	Deplorable service	We had been waiting for an 11:30am bus since 11:15am, right in front of the gate. Before we knew it, the doors had been shut in our faces and the bus departed. As we are not from the UK, we did not realise we had to walk out amongst the buses without any direction, and where we are from you usually board at the ticketed time. There was NO final boarding call and no indication that it was boarding (no sign, no people around the bus etc.)When we tried to resolve the issue, the National Rail staff were very ubrupt and not understanding of our issue. They pushed us back and forth until we had to book our own ticket.What worries me is the fact that this service is NOT inclusive of people from different backgrounds and those who may have hearing or visual impairments. It is clear that National Rail do not care for there customers, so I urge you to use another service in order to save your time and money.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

These were not made clear and the three staff members there were sat on a bench with their arms crossed. Then the train took a further 10 minutes than stated to get to the platform which also was not made clear. By the time the train finally came at 11:57 I didnt think it was still morning, I thought it was at least sometime in the evening, if not sometime next year.Thinking I was going to have a better journey home, I got the same train back which had another 1 hour delay due to a fault on the line which took my 40 minute journey on the way home, another 1 hour 45 minutes which again was not made clear and there was not one announcement.

2017-05-22T10:44:51Z	Last week my family and myself …	"Last week my family and myself completed our return journey from Birmingham airport to Newport south wales comprimising of: Birmingham international to Birmingham new Street - Birmingham New Street to Bristol Parkway and Bristol Parkway to Newport. Having had a poor journey to Birmingham international 14 days previous due to ignorant unhelpful platform staff at Newport and Birmingham ( At Newport they were more interested at sitting in there cabin than helping) we thought that things could only get better, how wrong were we. Well lets start at the beggining: After arriving via the shuttle to Birmingham International at around 8.45pm we could find nobody to ask what platform we needed for a train to Birmingham New Street so we had to figure it out ourselves via the info screens. Having arrived at Birmingham new street we spotted a platform guard so we waited for him to dispatch the train and asked him for the platform we needed to catch our train to Bristol Parkway well he was very rude and told us he did not know so we would have to use the info screen upstairs, what chance have we got of trains running smoothly if he did not know what train runs from what platform?. Having dragged our luggage between us 5 adults and 3 young children we figured it out. Arriving at Bristol Parkway we asked the platform attendant for the right platform for Newport expecting the same attitude as the last guard but to our suprise he was extremely helpful giving us the info we needed and helping us with the lift and pointing out that we could use the waiting room pointing out that we could turn the heaters on as we had over an hour to wait but then came the bad news the train was delayed due to signalling issues. Once the train arrived the guard was very helpful and helped us board the train as we had 6 pieces of luggage. Once on the train more bad news was announced "" Due to signalling issues we had to do a detour that would add around 45 minutes to our journey "" just what we did not need.We arrived at Newport at 02.15 instead of 01.27. Will I use the railway again NO NO NO Expensive but useless"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1
2017-05-22T10:44:51Z	I have recently visited the UK from …Australia	I have recently visited the UK from Australia with my son,sister and mother who is 88 years old. Although my mum is in fine form for her age, we required a wheelchair for most of our travels around the UK and London.I have to say that both British Rail and all of their staff were without doubt the friendliest and most helpful people anywhere. On every single occasion the staff were on hand with a ramp for my mum to help on and off the train. Not only that but, on each journey the staff asked for our destination and phoned ahead to have a fellow staff member ready with a ramp to help her off the train. They were extremely informative, friendly and went out of their way to help or advise us, nothing was too much trouble for them.Most people are very quick to criticise for bad experiences and it is not uncommon to hear bad reports about British Rail. To them I say, you need to travel an experience other countries, you have some of the best workers on your railway that I have ever seen in any industry anywhere in the world. I can't thank them enough for making our travels a pleasure.I would like you to relay my review to all British Rail staff if possible, you should be very proud of them.David Quinn	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	5

2017-05-22T10:44:51Z	National Rail issues	Whilst usually I find national rail journeys good, there have been several occasions on south west trains where the service is unsatisfactory! When the trains are delayed which I have faced several time there is no way in knowing when your next train will be it seems like it's just a waiting game! In addition they do not have the appropriate services such as update telephone boxes which you can use if your battery dies does not seem they are very modern at bestAlso, today I rushed for a train from work only knowing I had 2 minutes to jump on my train and the whistle was called at 13:21 with 22 seconds ! It says the train is at 13:22 but if you think that the train is at this time then you will afformidibly miss it! Even when I asked to jump on the train at 13:21 the lady continued to blow her whistle without an apology and now I have to wait 40 minutes for the next one as there train times are also a load of w***! So thank you south west trains i have a lot to do but i am unable to as i am waiting for my train! And do not get me started on the fares	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	3

Instead the conductor who I'd previously spoken to refused my ticket and made me purchase a new one. After explaining I simply couldn't afford it he explained I could be fined very loudly infront of everyone I felt so embarrassed. I was told no discount would be given even though I have a valid government card. When I arrived at my station which was seconds later I was furious so went to the information desk where I was told it was my own fault no complaint or refund will be handled. If you can get to your destination an alternative method I would definitely use it. It will be less stressful and properly won't have to pay twice.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

Firstly I received no ticket information from them after purchasing a ticket, so I called them up and then got it sorted, I tried to make a point that it was not fair that i had to receive the information half an hour before the trains departure, so I was redirected to the Team Leader Becca, who then firstly gave me a snide attitude for asking for compensation or even a proper explanation for something other than ""System fault"", and then also talked me while literally giggling.

2017-05-22T10:44:51Z	Disgusting service	One of the worst train companies I have ever used in London. Rubbish, never on time service. Delays and cancellations on a daily basis or every two days.

As I had very little finances at the time I gladly accepted and waited for her to get back to me with news that the ticket had been bought. To my astonishment she called me and said that she was unable to buy me a ticket as I'd need the debit card used to make the online purchase in order to collect it from the Self-collection Machine. How ridiculous! My partner wants to buy me a Ticket and she can't because I NEED HER DEBIT CARD to collect the ticket. There is something severly flawed with this service and I shall be making an official complaint. All that should be required is a name, date of birth, and ticket collection reference number. Not a debit card used by someone 50 miles away. Very flawed service that needs to be addressed.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

2017-05-22T10:44:51Z	Pretty awful service	I phoned National rail to find out why several trains had been cancelled to Brighton, none of the advisers spoke English and told me to check the website. Turns out they cancelled a load of trains just because the train guard didn't show up, meaning many people were stranded at Southampton Central, including myself who had a plane flight to catch early the next morning. Southampton Central is easily the worse run station ever, they seem to cancel trains all the time for absolutely no reason then give you stick for attempting your journey another way or tell you try again tomorrow and merely shrug their shoulders when you ask what is going on. I have also witnessed a member of public being verbally harassed by one of the train guards when she was desperately trying to get home but they cancelled many trains for absolutely no reason. Seems they all want to go home early and stick their feet up. Seriously stressful and nerve wracking when you've paid them to get you somewhere. Many times I've reported for compensation due to my journey not being made due to many cancelled services and never even received an email back. Pretty sure you have to refund and compensate if the train is cancelled National Rail!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

2020-10-31T10:21:40Z	Where do I start	Where do I start, After a long two hour wait in the freezing cold weather, I ended up being let down bye a national express coach that didn’t turn up. I decided the only option I had was to get on a train. I suffer from a mild mental illness and I had trouble getting a ticket sorted via my mobile phone. when I arrived on the platform I was very cold and distressed. I approached a woman sitting on a bench I believed to be the normal paying customer just waiting for the same train I needed, She told me not to worry and that I could buy a ticket once I was on it. It was the National rail on the 25th September 7:45pm departure from Nottingham station to London st pancreas, as it turns out she was actually the hostess/driver I think? She put me on the EMR first class. When I was seated She got me a cup of tea and a bottle of water that I didn’t have to pay for, Her name was Sally Mac. I can’t thank you enough lovely for your help and support and also for your first class professionalism and kindness towards me. I am very great full for everything you did for me and so glad it was you that i approached. It didn’t stop there, As Sally Had spoken to the ticket man Robert mail about my situation, He decided not to charge me for my journey. I was speechless and could not believe my luck. You guys are the best and I wanted national rail to know how lucky they are to have such amazing staff like the both of you. Again I can’t thank you enough from the bottom of my heart and will definitely be using this service from now on in the near future. Kind regards.

2020-10-31T10:21:40Z	This website is always down	This website is always down, it's so frustrating. As soon as you go to book a ticket it says there's been an error.

2020-10-31T10:21:40Z	Cyclists Treated Like Muck	This isn't the first time that I have been shouted at (told off) like a piece of dirt by railway staff. I've committed such crimes as rolling up to the ENTRANCE of Reading station, and putting my ticket into the machine while I still have a leg over the bike (because why take time to dismount when you are 1. Not even in the station yet, 2. Have a queue of people building up behind you and 3. You're about to pass through a narrow ticket gate, standing beside the bike is just impractical and awkward! Been shouted at by a rude bald masked staff member at Reading station entrance, hopefully he annoys the wrong cyclist one day and finds out what we all think of him! Just to note, in my 20 odd years of cycling I've never injured anyone except myself. I think I am capable of scooting through a gate, hardly riding down the escalators now is it?!I've also committed such crimes as waiting for my morning train to work and daring to take my bike onto a section of the train which is not labelled for bicycles. Well, 1. There ain't many of us so what's the big deal, 2. There isn't even always a cycling carriage, 3. There often isn't space for bikes if there is more than 1 bicycle boarding and 4. How am I supposed to know when waiting for a train where the cycling carriage is going to stop. It could end up stopping down the other end of the platform from where I waited and as shown above its a crime of the highest magnitude to cycle down to the carriage so I have before chosen to stand with my bike, out of the way, in a regular carriage and been spoken to like dirt. No wonder no-one wants to take the train unless they absolutely have to. Way to kill off your business even quicker	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1
2020-10-31T10:21:40Z	Masks not being worn	Took train from Carmarthen to Cardiff. Many teenagers were blatantly not wearing masks (some parents were fully aware and said nothing). No one checks if people are abiding by the law. I'm not sure why these people feel they can be excluded and endanger everyone else. Not a pleasant experience and did not feel safe.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1

2020-10-31T10:21:40Z	Horrible website	ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING  I cannot believe British Rail. Due to mental health reasons my daughter went on the web site to book a rail ticket to come up and stay with me' her mother.  The site let her on and allowed her to book a ticket and she paid her money which was accepted, A few days later she received a text to say the train had been cancelled.  She received another text today to say she is unable to get her money back as she should not have booked knowing the situation. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!  Why allow her to book the ticket'  why allow her to pay the money. A really poor way to make money British Rail especially when money is so precious due to job losses and no work	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1
2020-10-31T10:21:40Z	ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING	National Rail has rightly earned the reputation of Worst Customer Service in the country in my opinion.An elderly  friend was brought home to Scotland from Spain on a Rescue Flight and self isolated 14 days.His return Rail Ticket was from Kings Cross London. Obviously as he was brought directly to Scotlandhe had to buy another ticket to return from Glasgow.When he requested refund for ticket,  initially they refused. He explained the situation, was then asked for copy of ticket plus bank details etc.He is not familiar with internet so I took a picture of the ticket and sent them the bank details.They responded saying the ticket was not clear enough! They couldn't see the price.It is an extremely clear picture, but, in fact, even on the original ticket the price is very small.It wouldn't take a genius to check the ticket against the bank payment.I have sent them another 7 pics at 7 different angles so here's hoping common sense steps in!Pay the pensioner his money back for God's sake.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1
2020-10-31T10:21:40Z	National Rail Worst Customer Service in the Country!	Please please please I advise anyone reading this review do not I repeat do not make the mistake of purchasing a annual pass through network rail!!!. Sadly I made a huge mistake of purchasing a annual train pass In June 2019 for £897 to which I make a monthly payment to my company of £74.00 a month, Due to the cov-19 I have no other option than to work from home, so thought as I have 3 months remaining on my pass it would be wise to freeze my pass until I can travel again. I was told by the staff member that I could not freeze my pass but for the 3 remaining months left I could receive a partial repayment. At that point I expected to recieve a difference of £214 however was told that how they work out the difference It would mean that I'd get back £36.00. When I asked how they worked this out they could not explain, yet what is more frustrating is that  a number of my colleagues who purchased a swift card have managed to freeze their rail passes due to the coronavirus incident. I am absolutely appalled that National rail have nothing in place like all other companies to support there customers and offer such ridiculous partial repayments this makes no sense and is clearly day light robbery!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1
2020-10-31T10:21:40Z	The disappointment of this rail company!!	The national rail website is horrendously bad. It crashes almost everytime I go on it and from multiple devices so it's not just me.As a frequent train traveller, it has been this way for years-why haven't they fixed it?Train prices are also abysmal for the amount of delays and cancellations you get. I would say I get delays of more than 15 mins on 75-80% of my journeys. How are the prices higher than any other country and the service so much worse?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.nationalrail.co.uk	1
2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	Club cabin = great experience	Me and my boyfriend booked club cabin to go to Edinburgh and back in July this year and had a really good experience. Great beds, it was nice to have shower with all the free toiletries given. It's a shame that due to coronavirus lockdowns the restaurant / bar was closed but I think the team have done their best to accomodate with decent breakfast in the morning. It's true there's not much space for luggage so don't take 23kg suitcase if possible but good enough for small luggage. After all, it's a sleeper train. Overall, good experience.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	5
2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	Love the train, hate the misinformation	I've never experienced the old sleeper train, but I was thrilled with this one. Booking was easy, and there was a lot of information on COVID related changes, inc change in timetable. We got to Euston early as we didn't want to risk missing this (pricey) experience. There was no Caledonian staff present, and their stand was abandoned. Our altered timetable wasn't reflected on the departure board, and National Rail staff had no info on any changes. Luckily, cleaners and assistance crew knew more than info desk staff, and we found out where the train was and where to find the crew. There was no change to timetable despite online notice. On the train, I found the cabin cosy, bottom bunk comfortable, and the sink sufficient. My partner did not enjoy the top bunk as he found it to be somewhat uncomfortable. The train ride was nice too, but I agree with reviews saying that the night light was too strong and we ended up using information cards to cover lights. I would like to use it again but not for that price.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	4
2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	It really grieves us to give this poor…	It really grieves us to give this poor review. We have travelled north to our second home near Inverness and back to London many times on the old Sleeper over the last decade so we were excited to try the new carriages. It was a huge disappointment. Despite earlier feedback, the old fashion officious check in system remains unchanged. The new club class cabin  'room' looks good but the design has not retained sensible things like handles on the wall to get down from the top bunk.  The night lights are very bright and cannot be dimmed.  The top bunk has an uncomfortable edge.  The loo causes the toilet roll to become damp during the night. Delight at having a shower was dashed as the water remained cold despite running for 10 minutes.  Even with Covid, we will probably fly next time, which is really sad as we much prefer train travel. These things could and should have been resolved.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	2
2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	Disappointed	I travelled  on the old sleeper between  Inverness  and Euston  regularly over the last 10 years and  was eager to try the new service.What a disappointment. No 1 beds are more uncomfortable 2 cabin noise is more pronounced 3 no hot water(you could wash and shave with piping hot supply  previously)4 toilets use the unhygienic  dry suction method , and a backwards step from the old water based ones.5 the double hinged toilet doors are really  difficult to operate ,especially for older people.In short there absolutely  no improvement overall. Travelling on business you are not so focused  on other issues(such as food or refreshments) Your main concern is to have a decent sleep and arrive refreshed for the day ahead I'm  afraid the new sleeper falls short in all areas	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	2
2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	Don't waste your money when there are better alternatives	Booked a club room with a shower and toilet, I was told there was a fault with the room and moved rooms, of which this room also had a fault (the engineer had taken off the light fitting in the toilet/shower room) and was told I couldn't use the shower or toilet in the room. I was only given a 33% refund when the difference in price between a room with and without a toilet and shower is 50% (I was told by staff on the train I would be receiving a 50% refund); meaning I had to spend nearly 2 days without showering. I was also disturbed several times by the staff taking pictures of the fault. Just to add the breakfast is awful.Don't waste your money fly and stay in a hotel for the night, its a lot quicker and costs a similar price.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	1
2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	Broken Down Train, Tired and Hungry.	We definitely received the 'Hotel Experience'...The 'Fawlty Towers Hotel' Experience.We arrived at Glasgow Central for the 2340 to Euston with plenty of time to spare, being my first time on the sleeper I didn't know what the protocol was. There were no Caledonian Staff around to help, and no obvious instructions on our e-ticket. In the end we asked a member of Network Rail staff where the sleeper is and the directed us to the train. However, still no Caledonian Sleeper Staff to be seen! After getting cold on the platform were finally allowed on the train. Skip forward to 0600am. The train had broken down and was sitting just outside Preston (we should have been near London by now). The staff didn't have clear information for us, and there was no breakfast being served, not even a cup of tea! It was carnage. We ended up getting off at Wigan where we continued our journey by Avanti to London arriving into Euston 3.5 hours late, tired and hungry.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	1

Lights on all night, even though personal reading lights are available, as advertised. Late both ways with zero information. Some seats dont recline, must be broken all ready? Advice: dont do it.

2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	Absolutely ghastly: the Caledonian Sleeper Guest Experience Director should consider his position.	"The Caledonian Sleeper website describes the journey on one of its sleepers as a ""guest experience"" proclaiming the so called ""guest experience"" as a ""magical"" one. Passengers are advised to contact the Guest Experience Ambassadors to discuss any problems.There was nothing ""magical"" about the ""guest experience"" when I attempted to board the sleeper at Edinburgh Waverley last week. The train is supposed to be ready for boarding on the platform at Edinburgh at 2300 hours so that guests may retire to bed prior to departure at 23.40hours. Not for the first time, the staff left passengers on the platform in wintery freezing conditions until 23.30 hours without any explanation for the delay. As this is not the first time that I have had to wait on the platform for inordinate periods of time prior to being permitted to board the train, I deigned to query why this so called ""luxurious"" ""hotel on wheels"" was not available for boarding at the advertised time of 23.00hours. The Attendant noticeably bridled when I made my enquiry.  I was told, with a fake exaggerated smile,""The engine was late arriving and that I would just have to wait."" The absence of an apology was noticeable from the smug, supercilious, attendant who needs to be reminded that passengers are paying a minimum of £160 for their journey and, accordingly, have every right to expect civility and prompt information from those whom passengers help to keep in employment. My complimentary cup of tea did not arrive in the morning prior to my arrival at Euston despite ordering it and leaving the request card on the external door handle of my room ""no later than half an hour after departure."" It seems that the Caledonian Sleeper is very good at being officious and very poor with delivery of services. Logistically, it should not be beyond the wit of the Company to ensure that locomotives arrive on the platform on time so that they are tethered to the carriages so that passengers may board trains without freezing beforehand - other rail operators manage to do this so there is no excuse for the repeated failure of the Caledonian Sleeper to achieve similar standards.  I tried to discuss this matter with a Guest Service Ambassador on the telephone whose attitude left a great deal to be desired. He failed to apologise or even express regret.  He told me to pop everything down in an email presumably because he is too idle to put pen to paper to advise his managers of service failure of immense proportions. It is manifestly plain that ""diplomacy"" is not taught at the Caledonian Sleeper's Ambassadors' Charm School. Perhaps, I should write to the Secretary of State for Transport to suggest that SERCO should lose this franchise and enlist the support of my MP to represent my concerns to the Minister."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	1
2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	A terrible and depressing experience.	Have you ever wondered what a sardine feels like inside a tin can? Well, now you can find out! I was stupidly drawn into the experience that they are selling on their website, upon arrival to the train, instead of getting a feel of glitz and glamour, I felt like a prisoner, In a cell so small it hardly contained enough oxygen to keep a human being alive, let's try opening a window to get some air, you can't!On a serious note, this is the personification of late stage capitalism, where human beings are being herded in conditions worse than livestock travel for the pursuit of a companies bottom line, it's the most dehumanising experience I've witnessed in a developed nation. In short, no water to drink, no air to breathe, and no room to move. For your own sake, I hope you to avoid this company for your entire lives.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	1
2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	Poor but with potential	16th January service from Euston to Edinburgh. As avid sleeper train followers we were very excited and looking forward to the service. Trains are beautiful, lounge car is very stylish and Club cabins adequate.  Limited storage, making cabin difficult to orientate with 2 people.  Bed and bedding very good.Food is excellent and very good value for money. HOWEVER, organisation, reliability and response to issues are appalling.  Our train was running 3 hours late but we had no communication.  People in classic cabins had no options for food.  The train stopped and started and chugged along so that no one could really sleep.  But insult to injury they announced 3 hours after the train should have arrived in Edinburgh that they were not going to bother splitting the train and all passengers would have to go to Glasgow.All passengers were thrown off the train in Glasgow Central with no information or directions and expected to find their way to Glasgow Queen St station and onto Edinburgh.  Many older and foreign passengers had luggage or mobility problems and no help was offered. We eventually arrived in Edinburgh 5 hours late..	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	2
2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	Travelling Club Solo on the new…	Travelling Club Solo on the new Caledonian Sleeper between London Euston and Glasgow. I was down in London for a work trip and thankfully my work had sprung for First Class on the sleeper home. The last time I took a sleeper train was about 20 years ago and we only had seats in the old carriages, so anything was going to be better than that!With the Club Solo ticket I had access to the First Class Lounge in Euston which I was very thankful for with having 2 hours to kill before my train. In the lounge there were free drinks (non-alcoholic), snacks, comfy chairs and fast, free wifi. About 20 minutes before departure I went down to the platform where I was met by a couple of friendly staff members who gave me a keycard for my cabin. Inside the cabin itself was big enough for one person, I could put my bag and shoes under the bed, there was charging ports, heating dial, dimmable lights as well as a sink with toiletries and a spray to make your pillow smell nice. There was also an en-suite which could also be used as a shower room, very convenient in the middle of the night when you don't want to roam the corridors looking for a toilet! You also got ear plugs and a sleep mask. The bed itself was comfortable and of good quality, there was enough length that a person of my height - 6'4 - could 'just' stretch out, though my feet were up against the wall. The rocking motion of the train wasn't too bad, and the only noise was that of the train tracks. My only complaint really is the width of the bed, I'm quite broad shouldered so I felt a little confined in movement with the bed. The wifi onboard isn't the best either, so for streaming on Netflix I had to just use 4G on my phone. Come morning I went along to the Lounge car which was very nice and comfortable, and had my complimentary breakfast which was served at the time I'd requested on my card the night before. Breakfast was delicious as was the coffee. All in all it was a pleasant experience, though if I were to do it again I think I would try to get one of the double beds just so I had space to spread myself out a bit more!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	4
2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	Travelled on 2115 departure from Euston…	Travelled on 2115 departure from Euston to Fort William on Tuesday 7th January...I'm an OAP and paid nearly £300 return for a basic cabin. At just before 7am a knock on my door telling me train had broken down and to get all my belongings and go to buffet. No electric...no hot drinks...no heating...the failure of the electrics locked all the toilets. We waited 2.5 hours for road transport. The train had stopped at an unmanned tiny station....I wasn't offered any assistance and walked down 25 slippery stairs..it was raining and I had a bag in each hand so could not hold the rail. There were 12 passengers...we were put on a mini bus with a leaking roof the rain water had soaked the seats had to sit on that for 1.5 hours. What a way to travel in 2020. The return journey that night was replaced by a coach journey from Fort William to Edinburgh and you then got onto a train. How often is this happening. This incident wasn't reported on Thier website. They reserve the right to take up to 10 days to reply to your email. To top it all I've now got a severe cold. Just a nightmare!   Forgot to add I paid for a breakfast when I joined the train at Euston....didn't get it wasn't offered a refund because they couldn't open the cash register. B*lls*it!!!  Since I wrote this review there have been developments!!! The local newspaper covered it as a major story. Caledonian Sleeper refunded my complete fair and also offered me a free single ticket. I am of the opinion they were very sorry and I will give them another chance. I'm going again in February.....will let you know if I survive!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	1

Freezing water reminded me of the 1970s but I won’t use again until they resolve the shower and it is indicative of the esteem management hold their customers if they don’t make sure they fix this chronic and extreme miss-sell	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	1

2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	The most civilized way to travel between London and Scotland!	I was very weary by the reviews everywhere of the Caledonian Sleeper and I was starting to think that maybe I wouldn't enjoy it as much as I hoped I would! I was thankfully wrong.I travelled from London Euston to Inverness with my partner and caught the 2059 service. You are able to board the train around 30 minutes before departure which is great as you can put your luggage away and start to settle into your journey. Boarding was extremely unorganized. Herds of people just wandered outside the train with no information being given to passengers on how to access their room! My partner and I entered our berth for the 12 hour journey to Inverness. My initial thoughts of the room: very clean, cramped but cosy! The room wasn't cold or hot, a lovely temperature for winter. You are also given an amenity kit which consists of an eye-shades, earplugs and a water bottle. There is a control panel next to your bed, which has temperature control, a reading light, power socket, a button to call the host and many more which I can't remember! Once we familiarized ourselves - we tried to activate the lock on our door which took many attempts but we eventually got there. We rushed to the dining cart to find out it was nearly full! We hadn't even left London yet! If you want to have dinner on the train, please go to the dining cart as soon you put your luggage away! The dining cart fills up very quickly. We luckily managed to get a booth but the waiter kindly asked us if we would mind sharing it as some other passengers wanted dinner and there were no more tables available! Obviously we didn't mind but please bear this in mind if you're expecting an intimate dinner with your partner! The waiter took some time to get hold of which was understandable as it was very busy already! All the staff I encountered were very professional, friendly and well dressed. I ordered the lamb shacks for the main course and the fruit platter for dessert, both were delicious and the portion sizes were acceptable. The wine menu was decent and the prices were also reasonable for train food, too.After dinner, we descend into our berth for the night. We had the twin berth. The mattresses were actually not too bad. They weren't as amazing as some luxury hotel mattresses but it was definitely more comfortable than what I had expected! The linen was extremely comfortable, warm and clean! I'm 6ft and I didn't find the bed cramped at all. The noises levels on the train aren't as bad as some people make out (well, I don't think so anyway) I managed to sleep for about 4-5 hours and woke up near Perth. My partner requested tea for breakfast (which is complimentary in all the berths) but sadly - he never received. About 10 minutes prior to arrival into Inverness - there was an announcement made to say we will be arriving into Inverness shortly. We arrived bang on time.If you're looking for something luxurious like the Orient Express, perhaps this isn't it but if you're looking for something which will take you from London to Scotland in a civilized manner - then I would definitely recommend this. The only reason why I haven't given it 5* is because there were a few small things I didn't like, such as the buttons on the carriage doors made an annoying noise every time we alighted at a station! Not something you want to hear when you're trying to sleep! Other than that - I can't wait to travel on the Caledonian Sleeper again!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	4
2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	Good	Dont be put off by the negative reviews! We have been twice, both the old carriages and new en-suite. We had tremendous fun on both occasions.  As long as you understand you are on a blooming train and not a 5 star luxury resort hotel !! Yeap - the rooms are small but  comfortable, the sleep can be disjointed - yet cosy. The new carriages are better thanr the old ones which were  weathered around the edges, though always clean as they are now. The staff have been amazing, friendly and accommodating on both journeys. You cant beat the feeling once you've checked in - dumped your luggage in your own private space - pulled the cork on a nice bottle of red. Waking up in the Highlands is something else - the track is a single carriageway as the mountains, mist and heather roll by your window,	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	4
2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	Great trip, really enjoyed it!	Travelled from Euston to Fort William in November, after booking tickets my wife checked reviews and was so put off by the reviews on Trust Pilot she nearly cancelled and opted for a flight! Writing this review to balance things up as we had a genuinely wonderful trip that we will repeat - we now think it’s the only way to travel to the highlands. Firstly, it’s worth suggesting that don’t have too high expectations, this is not the Orient Express, it’s not perfect but for the money, a great value trip with some very pleasing surprises. - Wonderful welcome by friendly staff- Well appointed room, comfy bed and pillow (I’m only 5’8 so tall people may disagree)- Hard seats in the club car but great service, good half bottle Cotes du Rhone and a cheese board, bliss, great service again.- on board WiFi worked well enough (Though I downloaded a movie ahead of time)- my wife used the ear plugs and eye mask provided and slept well, woken briefly a few times. I found it a bit harder, a combination of the back lit button on my control panel (which I covered with a T-shirt) and the jolting train kept me awake but I caved in and used mask and plugs and then slept well (a lesson learned).-waking up to the morning gloom of the highlands was unforgettable- you are supposed to order breakfast when you board which we forgot to do but the staff had extra (I guess they always get one like me) and produced a delicious highland breakfast (and that view!).Not the smoothest of rides but it’s a train.. would be cramped for bigger taller people but all in all, this is a really terrific service and I will definitely be using it again!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	4
2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	My wife and I travelled London to…	My wife and I travelled London to Aberdeen in a Classic cabin on 11/11/19. The new coaches were poor. Top bunk ladder too vertical and rungs to narrow to climb in bare feet! Matresses offered no support and were very uncomfortable. Cabin temp too hot, no airconditioning. Constant loud wind noise from an air vent and a very rough ride at all times. Would not use again. The day train is much more comfortable.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	1
2020-09-07T07:33:46Z	Very Poor Design of Sleeper Rooms. Water in shower cold.	We were really looking forward to travelling on the new Caledonian Sleeper as have travelled on the older trains quite a lot and looked forward to the new experience. We were hugely disappointed though.The rooms felt very cramped. We have travelled on the older trains but the new trains feel more cramped. The top bunk is situated too high so it's impossible to sit up in bed, there is no shelf for personal items (watch, wallet, glasses etc.) even though there is space for this. The ladder to the top bunk is completely vertical so it's very hard to climb up/down. We paid to travel in a Club room but was very disappointed that we could not use the shower as the water was way too cold (even after we ran it for a while to see if it would warm up but it didn't) so we paid for a facility which we could not use. It was already November (so a cold month) and then to have a cold shower is not appealing. There is a handy pull-out table but this blocks the entrance to the toilet when in use.Also, the ride felt VERY bumpy. I could feel the bumps and jolts a lot more than the older Caledonian sleeper train. I also travelled from London Paddington to Penzance on the Night Rivieria sleeper train which was a lot more comfortable. The suspension on the new Caledonian trains seems quite poor. It feels that the design of the train was not properly tested with real users otherwise why would the ladder be so vertical and the pull-out table block the toilet/shower door and lack of space to sit up. Where do management expect people to put personal items when sleeping - glasses, watch etc? A small shelf would have been ideal. On the plus side:- Website booking process was easy to use - The staff on board the train were really good- Breakfast was good - Bar car was good (seats somewhat hard but may soften with time)- Food and drinks choices and prices in the bar car was good - The toilet in the Club room was really nice to have- We arrived on timeOverall, in future I would fly - but if you can put up with the downsides this is a novel way to travel between London and Scotland and the staff on board were lovely.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	2
2019-11-11T17:12:58Z	A wasted design oppotunity	Couldn't wait to try the Caledonian Sleeper service, using the new rolling stock, as loved the old ones we used from the 1980s onwards to and from Inverness and London. Now we live in Invernesshire, this seemed the best way to come back from London, so didn't get back in the dark at night, but in the morning, refreshed, instead. Not great at Euston, as only went up on board 15 mins beforehand, then a rush to find the platform and the right sleeping apartment. The Scotsman at barrier was charming, the attendant seeing us onto the train and ticking us off list, not so, on the rude side of disorganised. The standard sleeping room, two bunk beds, which we used to travel on, not that well re-designed, in fact the old design was better. The ladder is dead straight against the bunks, making it hard to get up to top one (used to be sloping and allow more space at bottom too). The hard metal stand for putting mobile devices in, against each bedhead, is a treat to head injuries. The padded sides that used to keep you safely in the top bunk as gone, the small thingey now replacing it, makes turning over in bed deadly. OK, we accept, not the real china cups anymore for morning tea/coffee, but the cardboard versions feel cheap and tacky and are they even recycled? I did manage the bathroom door, everyone else was complaining about getting in through the strange folding doors, but the loo was very noisy and nearly sucked you in too! The sleeping room was noisy due to the wheels sounding like they were coming off, didn't sound too safe and very bumpy compared to the old rolling stock. Could have done with mirrors and hooks in better places and just a lot more thought, this feels very basic, but an idea way to travel, which used to be a delight. The staff, very sadly, need some training in how to talk to people too, this makes so much difference to what should be a pleasant experience. However, managed to sleep, despite all this, as for some strange reason, I always sleep better in moving trains and ships that at home in bed!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	3
2019-11-11T17:12:58Z	Nancy and Julie, the best hostesses any company could have	I was injured in a fall at Euston before boarding the sleeper, I went to the dining car to ask for ice and I have never before had such kind and thoughtful service, ice was packed around my leg and I was encouraged to stay till the pain eased, I then went back to my cabin, one of the two hostess followed me, bandaged up my leg and made sure I was comfortable. The next morning I got an intercom call to check I was alright and a colleague of the two women came to help me down the step.Julie and Nancy, dining car hostesses on the Caledonian sleeper on November 6 are the best ambassadors the company could have, customer care like that makes up for a lot of the teething troubles of the service.My ankle was broken.Helen November 7 2019	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	5
2019-11-11T17:12:58Z	Made my first journey on the new…	"Made my first journey on the new sleepers, in Club First. On the day of departure I received a text telling me that there would be no food service in the Lounge car due to ""last minute staff shortage"". (This was some nine hours before departure....very last-minute)  The new Lounge Car has hard and uncomfortable seats and is clearly intended to get you out of there asap. The ""shower"" was like a badly made cheap child's toy. 45 seconds of water then you have to push the taps again. Took five attempts before the water was tepid. The shower soaks the floor so if you go to the loo in the middle of the night you'll get your feet very wet! I was woken around 0100 by water pouring on to my face from a leak in the cabin. I had to get dressed and move all my stuff to another cabin, so not much sleep. The promised showers and toilets at the Virgin Lounge at Euston were not functioning and apparently hadn't been for some time. The ticket was £182. The refund was £55, and I had to hold on the phone for 15 minutes just to get that authorised.  The three people who crewed the entire Glasgow to London sleeper that night did their best but it seems that management are simply not up to running a railway."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	1

(This was until train split at Edinburgh when normal temp resumed).-Carriage toilet blocked by half way through journey (both became blocked during second half).-No power points fitted at seating-Partition table no more than a triangular cup stand.I priced a one-way berth 2 days before travel and when booking the next day there were none available but the price paid remained the same £176. I asked upon boarding if a cabin was available and was told yes but for an additional £140 - £316 no thanks!Caveat - arrived safe and on time.

A few fitting names: Caledon't sleep, Calecan't be on time, and so on and so forth. Not worth the money, not worth the time. Sorry to be a let-down here, but almost everyone I spoke to on this train thinks that the service is performing poorly. Things to go forward on: live travel time updates on the screen, communication from the driver or someone who knows what is happening, reclining seats maybe? EAr plugs don't work, so bring your own, as there will be some cuckoo lady jamming to whatever during the night...	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	1

But, the worst thing is that they seem to have forgotten the train suspension - every thing felt.  Would not use again - I’ll fly.

I know what to expect, and it's so good to wake up at the other end of the UK. I've come on to TrustPilot to review them as I had a problem with my travel plans and needed to make a change, and the man at the end of the phone this afternoon was so helpful in letting me change plans for Friday night, so the journey could start in Inverness not Edinburgh. I really appreciated having a listening ear to the difficulties that had come up, and the discretionary treatment was very welcome.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	5
2019-11-11T17:12:58Z	Seriously don't know how they expect…	Seriously don't know how they expect someone to sleep in a chair that reclines less than an inch. Advertised as luxury reclining chair, in fact the same as the abellio service chairs, comfort wise. Unless you shell out for a private cabin (cheaper to fly-and quicker), you'll be in a fully lit compartment which can not be dimmed 'for safety reasons'.100% the worst way to travel from Scotland to London if you actually have plans other than catching up on sleep once you arrive. Would highly encourage someone to seek other options of transport.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	1

2019-11-11T17:12:58Z	Air conditioning broken, pre-ordered breakfast not available	The air conditioning was broken on my outward journey. According to the attendant it had been broken for some time and he wasn't very pleased that it hadn't been fixed yet despite his pleas to higher powers for this to happen. I endured a very uncomfortable night during which I was either very hot or, having taken the covers off me and after the temperature had dropped, very cold. I woke up in the morning with a sore throat and hoarseness, and my voice hasn't recovered even now, 10 days later. I can only think that the reason it wasn't fixed in a timely manner has something to do with the fact that the trains are soon to be replaced. On one leg of the only other journey I have made with Caledonian sleeper, there was a problem with the ventilation which meant we had to sleep with the doors open to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Presumably some suit in an office somewhere decided it would be a shrewd business move to spend money on advertising the new fleet of trains, rather then rushing to ensure that customers have a comfortable journey in existing trains that will soon go out of use. No refund was offered for the lack of air conditioning.Additionally, on my return journey the breakfast option I had ordered a month before when booking the journey (and also confirmed on the evening of travel) had run out, and I was given instead a limited choice of 2 options - if I had had any allergies or dietary/religious requirements I could easily have gone hungry. Luckily, as it was I was merely annoyed to have a less good option. Also the breakfast did not come with orange juice as specified. Perhaps this was a mistake but I didn't want to make it awkward by querying this in case the reason was they had run out of this too. I would have thought that if they allow you to pre-order food then they would ensure they had enough of each type of meal to cater for the orders, especially given that many people have dietary restrictions.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	1
2019-11-11T17:12:58Z	Railcard users beware	Railcard users beware, Caledonian Sleeper have decided to no longer honour senior and other discount rail cards when you book their twin berth cabins. They claim it is because of the new trains - actually it seems to just be a convenient revision to their booking rules to extract more money from their passengers. The website gives the impression that the discount has been applied when booking - but it hasn't. Very disappointing behaviour.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	1
2019-11-11T17:12:58Z	Falls well short of expectations set by the marketing - VERY POOR!	Poor experience from start to finish. The most impressive thing is the marketing!... the experience falls well short of this.Forget a relaxing night’s sleep to Scotland, you feel every rivet of the track as you’re jolted around like a jelly on a vibrating plate.Old, tired train carriages are in need of significant refurbishment, they completely lack style and practicality. Rooms and dining car lack cleanliness. In-room washing facilities are not adequate, partly due to lack of a mixer-tap and scalding hot water. Toilets are basic. Food, whilst well presented, is very poor – microwaved meals, seriously?! With the kitchen door left open, viewing the food preparation is not very appetising. Staff were fine, but better training is required to ensure they deliver the best possible customer experience – it currently lacks refinement or a personal touch.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	1

2019-11-11T17:12:58Z	Excellent Service	Just travelled up and down to Scotland on the sleeper and the staff and service has been brilliant. You get woken up when you want (for me after the train has arrived so you get as much sleep as possible) the beds are comfortable and there is plenty of room for luggage on board.You don't sleep as well as in a proper bed, but that is to be expected, on the other hand you arrive at your destination early in the morning meaning you get the better part of two extra days in Scotland more than you'd get by driving up, getting the daytime train or flying.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	5

Due to this, and the fact that I have to work this weekend, I will be in London and had to seek a refund: the process was fast and sleek and the refund processed in short order.I'll be travelling on the Caledonian Sleeper again soon!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/sleeper.scot	4

I got on broad on time and claimed my seat,  the ticket guy came to check my ticket I had a online ticket from Carlton (Nottingham) to Exeter St David’s and had 4 different changes to make until I reach my destination. I showed my ticket to the man and was asked to buy a new ticket as I have not printed my tickets. I explained to the man that The machine wasn’t working therefore I couldn’t print the ticket. The man kept forcing me to buy a ticket and I refused as I had already bought one. He said he’ll come back to me after he’s checked all the others passengers tickets. Before he left I asked him if he could print the ticket from his machine and he refused as he said that is not the company policy as I have to purchase a new ticket. Whilst he was gone to check other passengers ticket I noticed the manager  of the train Named Phill was passing by. I stopped the manger and simply asked if he could print the tickets for me as I couldn’t do it on the station. Phill responded with a smile that of course he can and printed the tickets for me immediately. He was really kind and helpful and asked if he could assist me with anything else. I just want to say a massive thank you to Phill( Manager) for his great service and making my journey more comfortable. As of the other man names Ean I think east middlands need to investigate man Name Ean as I think he was clearly just trying to make his sales and not caring about the customer at all.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	4

There was no obvious reason as to why I couldn't get on via my chosen door!!! Also, their trains  are very outdated and crappy, out of touch with 21 century, no working wi-fi on board!

This claim has been going on for weeks and they kept telling me I could not receive a refund unless I sent the request from the originator email address. Yet I booked the tickets via their website! I have confirmed reference on the tickets, amount paid, and date purchased. Their system does not accept the email address as being on their system even though I have received 2 COVD-19 emails regarding advise on travel during this crisis. I was then asked to send a picture of cut up tickets, which I did, I then had an apology 're the email problem and was advised I would receive my refund with 28 days. Then many days later I received a further email saying once again my request must be from the originator email. I messaged them again at my disgust and frustration  over all of this and told them I had been promised a refund on 6th April now you are once again back tracking and saying you can't refund over an email address your system won't recognise! They have now confirmed again I will receive a refund within 28 days of latest email of 17th April! I requested the 28 days was backdated to 6th April as was promised a refund then, now they are saying this cannot be altered as has been set to refund 28 days from 17th April. They are obviously stalling for time and I am disgusted with their service. I have tried asking thay they just be honest and tell me they are inundated with requests and dealing with them asap, but no they wont and just making things as difficult as possible for me to receive back my refund.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

2020-10-04T17:05:26Z	Disgraceful exploitation by EMR…	Last Monday my son had a super off peak ticket (bought for £40 on a 16-25 rail card) and wanted to travel on the 6.23am train from London to Derby. He was refused entry at the gate as this train only accepted off peak tickets. He asked if he could pay the difference. He was asked to pay £94. The cost of the ticket on line for the same journey at the same time is £43.25. I called Customer Services to complain about his treatment. They didn't care - either I could set up a complaint requiring all my personal details (for data capture) or I could get a call back from a manager within 72 hours. I chose a call back. One week later I have heard nothing. EMR in effect tried to rob my son at the gate. I suspect I didn't get a call back because no one could defend such blatant exploitation. EMR should be ashamed of themselves. Nationalise now!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

2020-10-04T17:05:26Z	DO NOT BOOK 1ST CLASS AT WEEKEND	How they have the cheek to call this first class is beyond me. Upgraded to first at weekend as a treat for my husband which translated as a cup of watered down coffee & twin pack biscuits. Train is empty so could've sat in standard with double seat each, Wi-Fi (not reliable) & phone charger & then spent the £24 on food & a newspaper, neither of which were provided on this train. There is absolutely no point going first class at weekend other than to line the pockets of EMR even further	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

(best of a bad situation right?) NO! they charged me £10 per person per ticket (£40 in total) for changing the date (despite me buying 4 tickets in the same transaction)  THEN SAID if i dont have a specific date to travel on i can cancel just reschedule these tickets (AGAIN FOR £10 PER PERSON PER TICKET)Complete daylight robbery, awful awful company and was on hold for 40 minutes for this - how can we be expected to take public transport with service and charges like this!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

2020-10-04T17:05:26Z	Rude and overpriced. Out of touch with 21st century	I can not understand how this rail company is so brazen in just how bad it is. The tickets are extraordinarily expensive, the staff are rude and don’t seem to like customers and treat people with contempt. The most irritating thing about this rail company is the prohibitive cost of using their services. In a time when we should be looking to use public transport to reduce our need to use cars I am at a loss to understand how they have the front to charge the prices that they do for a family to visit London. Very disappointed and very irritated that EMR is so out of touch with consumer needs.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

I'm late, so I have plenty of time to write this review :) I'm missing my connection too :) I'm using my time to submit all my delay repays I hadn't got round to doing. :)I now try to get journeys via London to avoid EMR to Luton.

Travelling in the morning but am unable to collect tickets as the ticket office closes at 2 pm, I got there 2.10 pm and the collection machines are not working.  This happens so often that I normally get them in advance but this time was unable to do so.  As I am going to a funeral, and have to get 3 trains and am an OAP I don't need this stress.  When ringing they just say to go to the next station.  25 miles round trip and I have no transport which is why I am getting the train!  Have no idea what I am going to do in the morning when I have to get the train and will have to tell the ticket inspector I don't have one.  I will get an earlier train so I can hopefully get them at my first connection stop.  They do not care about their service users at all.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

Far, far worse than East Midlands Trains, who actually weren't too bad. Even worse than the worst days of BR. I'm going back to using the car... They're not getting any more of my money on the pretence of actually providing a useable service, as the whole thing seems to be run by a team of incompetents.

I don’t travel that frequently, about every 2 weeks, but this year I seem to spend a lot of my time claiming money back for delays and cancellations. Yesterday was fairly typical with a train from Chesterfield to Manchester delayed 20 mins, and the train back delayed an hour and exceedingly crowded with people forced to stand down the aisles, and impossible for anybody to move.To be fair to EMR at least 50% of the delays are not their fault, being caused by broken down trains that have blocked the tracks, point failures, and overhead cable issues which are down to the state of the railway network which remains in a terrible state and has not got the capacity for current demand	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	2
2019-12-17T09:54:19Z	East Midlands Railway are terrible	East midland trains has rebranded you east midland railway (EMR). Since this Change has taken place I’ve had nothing but problems. The all new free WiFi is simply garbage. I would occasionally book 1st class to allow me the ability to work. This is now pointless as the free WiFi to all has ruined the 1st class WiFi as nothing works. Also, this week, I have had 4 trains. 3 were late in some way. One lost its seat reservations and the other didn’t have any food or drink on it. Not one was how it should be. It is simply terrible. And not the first time. I’ve had issues since EMR came about. Having complained to EMR on several occasions I have been fobbed off each time. An apology is nice but no action seems to be taken. They seem to simply not care. And to add to other reviews, the staff are usually awful and rude. The prices are high. The carriages are old and dirty. It is not good enough.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

2019-12-17T09:54:19Z	Consistently awful	Gave up on this train company after being a regular traveller as they were that bad. You're not guaranteed to get a seat even if you book one months ahead. Trains turn up missing carriages on a regular basis meaning there are 30-40 people standing in each carriage as it's ridiculously overcrowded. Sometimes people have been refused as there's no room even though they have a ticket for that particular train. No air con means it's stifling in the summer and the prices are expensive, never again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

I have a fear of dogs some people like them but I don’t. She wasn’t helpful at all. I had two of my children with me. And she suggested to go and find seats in another carriage. The conductor didn’t help us in anyway and just told us to move elsewhere. The women behind me found it funny as we moved because of a dog. I’ve never had a problem with East Midlands trains.

We'd planned to have the promised free coffee and cookies on our early morning train only to be told after the train started that there was no catering that trip. On return journey our booked seats were non existent so had to keep moving seats to find some that weren't booked by others. On top of that the toilet door was malfunctioning so after another passenger got locked in we had no toilet available for the journey. What a farce!!

2019-09-18T16:18:32Z	Dreadful service	After arriving at Nottingham from London I needed some help understanding the ticketing system for my onward travel and was ultimately met with hostility by the onboard conductor.My emails to Eastmid trains to clarify the situation haven't been answered.Overall, a disappointing service with total lack of customer focus.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	2
2019-09-18T16:18:32Z	Too expensive and no WiFi on board…	Too expensive and no WiFi on board their trains. Signal is poor and stations are dated also apart from St Pancras. Their trains are running many years behind modern trains and I speak from experience having had to travel on their trains for many years.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1
2019-09-18T16:18:32Z	A good experience	After reading the reviews I was a bit concerned about the standard of first class so I was very pleased that my journey both ways from St Pancras to Nottingham and back was excellent. Staff were friendly and helpful. Seats comfy and carriage clean.Only thing stopping 5 stars was the poor WiFi and the initial lack of a buffet car due to staff shortages on way back though a trolley did come round later.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	4

"Took the 1902 train from St. Pancras to Sheffield on Saturday 6th July 2019.We had reserved seats but no reservations were shown at all, in our coach at least. Seats were uncomfortable, and upholstery dirty and frayed in places. Obviously well past their working life. Windows very dirty. There was no on board catering at all ""because of staff shortage"". Saw no train staff at all in the entire journey. I am so glad we did not pay the extra premium for first class. The train was, however, on time."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	2

Purchased two bacon ciabatta from the buffet car. Woman needs to go on some form of customer service training. The ciabatta were soggy and bacon horrible. I asked for a cappuccino (which I got) but had to pay nearly 11 pounds for the privilege of 1st class. We got 1 free cup of tea. Had to endure moaning and grumbling as everyone sat in everyone elses seat.

2019-05-29T19:32:28Z	Extremely helpfull staff !!!!!	Having mainly read Google reviews prior to travelling to London this Saturday (18/5) I was very cynical and sceptical of the service I may have expected to receive at Nottingham railway station. Staff were purportedly rude, unhelpful and down-right discourteous!!! That couldn't be further from the truth.I was extremely pleasantly surprised. Due to an error in the automated allocation of tickets prior to the day of travel, I had to try and obtain an additional railcard to facilitate travel on the tube (already paid for.)  On the way to the machine I was met by a female member of staff (sorry didn't obtain her name) who offered assistance without having to be asked. Unfortunately she was unable to resolve the issue and I was referred to the ticket office. I wasn't pressed for time but conscious it was ticking. The queue moved quickly and I was dealt with by Charlotte. She queried why another railcard had not been issued and left her station to check. She returned, couldn't establish why it hadn't been issued but issued another railcard and travel 'warrant' without question. I felt guilty for the queue that had built behind me. We went on our way !! The only downside was the original railcard issued didn't seem to work in the barriers in London but with cursary checks I was allowed through. Together with my daughter, I had a lovely day in London at the Netball Super league finals. The day could have got off to a bad start but both Charlotte and the other member of staff went the extra mile to ensure there were no hiccups in the travel to and from the capital. I hope their supervisors pick this up and pass on my extreme thanks and gratitude for their professional and courteous manner.

2019-05-29T19:32:28Z	Train from St Pancras to Sheffield	The train was entirely unticketed, and so they had no way of controlling how many people tried to get on the train.

2019-05-29T19:32:28Z	General rant about eastmidlandstrains	I have travelled using eastmidlandtrains a lot between Nottingham and Bedford for the past two years. Since the updated timetable last Spring-time, I have become increasingly disappointed with the services. Travelling from Bedford is now awkward as you either have to travel before 16:00pm or after 19:00pm to get a direct train north to Leicester, Loughborough and Nottingham.Trains are often delayed going either south or north, even though the train originates at Nottingham (where I get on), and train staff hardly ever apologise for the delayed trains even though myself and other customers often miss connecting trains or buses as some delays have reached 30+ mins with no apologies.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	2
2019-05-29T19:32:28Z	Consistently Late	Trains were late 90% of the time so I ended up not using them anymore and finding a job elsewhere. Ticket prices a joke with limited seating and poor punctuality.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

Not quite the response I was expecting! - Especially since I’d paid and now was sitting in this miserable excuse of a service. Apparently this was announced but the on train tannoy announcements were inaudible- as I said, the carriage was old and dirty. So, no first class lounge at the station - actually closed at weekends!!! - yes, really!  No refreshments  of any kind to be had on the train - dirty old shed of a carriage - What the actual HELL did I pay for 1st class tickets for?

2019-05-29T19:32:28Z	Awful Train Service	East Midlands Trains service is without doubt the worst train operator. I am continually appalled by their inability to provide services on time. In the six years that I have reliably used the East Midlands service, I doubt there have been more a handful of times when the services are on time. Ticket operators are often rude and the trolley service is normally poor, not running when it should be. The only reason I would ever get a train with this operator is because it is quicker than other forms of transport. Otherwise I totally begrudge paying a single penny to this train operator when their service is so appalling. Do not spend your hard eard money on tickets for this ‘service’.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

2019-02-15T15:42:24Z	East Midlands Trains services	Hello people. For anyone wanting a trip from say Derby to Leeds, go with East Midlands Trains (EMT) on a quiet Sunday night when there's no engineering works! The 22:40ish CrossCountry service from Derby to Leeds is now diagrammed for a 4-coach Voyager and not an HST (200 seats (26 of which are First Class) instead of 457 (70 of which are First Class). From Oxford I was going to catch the 20:06 to Birmingham New Street (BNS) then the 22:03 to Leeds from there which is the 22:41 from Derby.It's not often I use this 'G' word but thank god there's a back-up option but from Derby (which I'd catch the 20:49 Nottingham train from BNS) - the 22:48 to Leeds which I'm told by EMT has to be formed of an HST. 8 coaches on this service. There's I believe 111 First Class seats on these (and I think 357 Standard Class seats) - I'm told their catering services usually end at Sheffield. So if you want more seats and say a coffee then my advice is get the 22:48 and head for the buffet! I don't know how busy the 22:48 is however.But note that catering isn't guaranteed on services scheduled to have catering though - meaning it's advertised in the timetable but can't always be provided.If you're not happy with any EMT trip then they fully sympathise.EMT are a train operator I'd recommend to people definitely :-) 👍!My plan is to take this service on Sunday 28th April in a few months time of all is ok.Also, the first / amongst the first trains from Leeds to Sheffield are the 05:19 East Midlands Trains HST service on weekdays. This calls at Doncaster and Wakefield Westgate and takes around 65 minutes. Because of single fares involved, I plan to take this service to Sheffield and get the 07:18 CrossCountry service from there to Oxford on the 29/04/19. The 07:18 I'd buy an Advance Single to BNS then from there to Oxford (sort of split ticketing).	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	5
2019-02-15T15:42:24Z	£1.71 more important than maintaining company's reputation	I was taking a train from Liverpool to Manchester. Liverpool FC had been playing, so the city was buzzing. However, I was not worried as I had booked a train and a seat. I arrive at the station and people are queueing to get in for some standing space. I speak to the people working at the station, who make it seem like this is my fault. So I did not even get on this train. Instead, I have to wait for over an hour - because the next train is of course delayed - with Liverpool fans. Once the next train arrives, I had to steal someone else's seat. It is a vicious circle. On my way to Manchester, I saw that this is an issue with most trains, i.e. a reoccurring scenario and not a one-off. I had to cancel my evening plans because of this. Nevertheless, the most laughable aspect of this is that when I got in touch with the company to point out that it is a shambles (and not to get a refund), they apologise about five times - no need to pretend you are sorry. If you were, you would not let this company be a shambles. Where is the pride? The expertise? The knowledge? - and they also offered to reimburse 75% of the £6.85 that I paid. I told them to give it to charity. If saving £1.71 is more important to you than maintaining the company's reputation, I feel embarrassed to accept money from you. Good luck	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1
2019-02-15T15:42:24Z	Amazing staff at Nottingham station!!!	I can't say enough how amazingly helpful staff were at Nottingham station yesterday! Stupidly I had my ticket downloaded on my phone which died just as I got the station. The staff at the desk did everything they could to get me home. The gentlemen at the desk produced a power bank and the lady got me a cable to charge with that waited till my phone had enough battery life to switch on and took my ticket information down and wrote a slip for me to get on the train. The gentlemen even give me his power bank after and told me to keep it on me at all times! Added to the magic of it all that it was Christmas but I was so grateful for their help. At the entrance to the station the gentelne who had seen my phone die walked me down to the train and double checked it was the correct one foe me to get on. It was little like VIP service all because I was a dumbass who didn't print off my tickets! Lesson learned. But I do really want to say thanks to everyone who helped me yesterday...

2019-02-15T15:42:24Z	Service not great	Terrible service. They put on fewer coaches than was required for the journey from the Sunday 9.56am St Pancras trip to Nottingham, resulting in a mad dash for space in an obviously oversubscribed service. Removing all reservations helped a little, but provided little consolation to those who paid more for 1st Class seats, or those who have took the time to reserve a spot. To his credit the guard/staff did all he could to make things comfortable, but it was obvious he was just as exasperated as the rest of us. Pity - the trip down was pretty good the day before, however I'm led to believe overcrowded service is somewhat the norm for EMT. I'll drive next time.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

Anyone, if you have any other means of transport, don't use EMT! They are waste of time and money!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1
2019-02-15T15:42:24Z	Refund joke	After my partner who has been travelling to London every day for the past 10 years. We are not able to get a yearly or monthly ticket so he gets a weekly one. And last week the first time ever he lost this and weekly ticket and the eastmidlands train refused to refund this because it was a weekly ticket found this absolutely absurd that this could not be fixed as we sent copies of receipt and they kept asking if we had the photo card we could be refunded but it's loatvthat was the whole point. Customer support have not helped at all apart from giving excuses to why this could not be refunded. Anybody who is the same position I would advise to take pics of your season card a very angry customer.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

It was meant to leave from Nottingham at 09:47 I got near the train at 09:45 and the whistle was blown and the train was told to go! I paid for this train to leave at 09:47 I don’t understand why it has to leave 2 minutes before it’s due to leave! And then I’m being told by the staff members to “move away from the train”! Absolutely disgusting! If you want the train to leave at 09:45 then state that on your tickets! Instead of stating 09:47 and then leaving 2 minutes before!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

Reluctant regular user for 10 years.Used EMT regularly for about 10 years travelling from London to Derby to visit family and friends.This is probably the worse train company service experience, having used most of the others. First class is a joke. I recognise the earlier comments that the train team either sit at the end of a first class carriage near the galley or congregate in the galley. A number of times, having received no service, I went to the galley door and the reaction is priceless.Surly, resentful and condescending. And that's with the train manager sitting with them!Weekend trains were often cancelled, late or short trains with seat reservations turned off.Now moved to the West Country and use GWR who are brilliant.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1
2018-10-24T10:58:00Z	Funny that you had no charge!	Funny, I wanted to swap my ticket for an earlier train. Apparently there was a set charge of £10-that was before any difference in price which I was willing to pay. So I waited-the train before had been cancelled-the seat supposedly reserved for me was non-existent. The carriage where my seat was didn't exist. It went A, D...There was not enough room to put your luggage so passengers from Sheffield to Manchester had put there luggage on the seat. The train was filthy. Shame Eastmidlandtrains. I would ask for a refund for such an unacceptable experience.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1
2018-10-24T10:58:00Z	Hassle-Free, Friendly Service!	I wanted to swap my ticket for a different date/time but couldn't do so via the app, as I'd purchased mobile tickets. I rang the helpline and within 5 minutes, my ticket had been swapped and a refund had been issued - no fuss, no hassle, no difficult procedure that is just used to try and take your money! All completed with a friendly, helpful service from Umer - thank you East Mids Trains! :)	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	5

But I noticed my friend stayed calm, he said customer service of this train line is very good. We called the available number to ask for guidance on what we could do next, but the queing was long. Luckily we managed to retrieve the booking number through screen shot on video chat of Facebook messenger that we downloaded on my phone as Gmail didn't let him login on my phone. Then we went to the St Pancras East midland information office. What impressed me was this manager Hasan Tafader so ready to help us all sorts of passengers some panicking, some of us lost. He was telling people which train to go to and so on whilst listening to our unfortunate situation and he actually helped us feel relieved by his calm demeanour. At times London can appear cold because of all the husling and bustling but we felt looked after that day. Good one East Midlands trainline!  My friend who I was meeting after 13 years got home safely as the manager took the booking reference and checked something and wrote slip for my friend. We really were impressed with how calm and wonderful and helpful this manager was. I had to take his name as he played important role that day in appreciating goodness in human beings and  this trainline.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	5
2018-10-24T10:58:00Z	Service really could be better	One of the most disruptive rail service providers. 80% of my journeys with them in the last 10 months have been delayed, cancelled or something of the sort. Making a journey where you have to connect is a nightmare if you need to rely on East Midlands because they have been so unreliable.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

Had to stand in the middle of the train in this heat with about 30+ other people this didn’t feel safe, when trying to get off the train had to slide down the train pushing in to other people and struggling to get off the train which resulted in me nearly missing my stop. I just think if they cancel a train they should at least realise that they need a bigger train as a lot people had to wait for the next one I would rated is 0/5 stars if I was able to I won’t be travelling with them again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1
2018-10-24T10:58:00Z	Vile customer service	The poorest customer service I have ever experienced. Around Christmas 2017 a female instructor insisted I spent £35 on a new ticket from Sheffield to Nottingham even though I could clearly evidence I had purchased a specified ticket for the train I was travelling on. She was rude, disparaging and aggressive in front of other passengers with no appreciation that other passengers could hear her shouting at me. To top it it off when I complained they never provided a refund even though, again, I had confirmation of my purchase. Absolutely vile company, which I will continue to boycott through using other train services and booking tickets through alternative company sites. They should be ashamed to have workers like this representing their company.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

In addition, a friend of mine lost her wallet, and the staff was rather unhelpful and rude on giving her guidance on how to find it. Moreover, the customer service telephone line is the WORST service ever, I waited for over 20 minutes and the line was cut off.

Got on the train at St Pancras and there was only water on offer.  No tea, no coffee, no snacks. She was so hungry and was desperate for a cup of tea! Absolutely appalling. Travelling on her own, she couldn't leave her things to go in search of a buffet car.  They take the first class fare but do not offer the service.  How do they get away with this? We went first class with Virgin trains and it was absolutely fantastic.  At service food and drinks and the first class lounge for the return journey was  wonderful with ample food and drinks available and on the journey itself we had sandwiches, biscuits, drinks etc.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1
2018-04-28T10:27:07Z	Rip off merchants!	As a regular First Class traveller with this train company, I am totally brassed off with how they're allowed to get away with charging First Class ticket prices whilst not providing First Class service. For example, I travelled from Leicester to Derby last night (27 Apr 18) on the 22.03 service. It was announced at Leicester station there would be an at-seat service on the train but did I see one? Of course not! There were five female members of the on-train team stood in the area at the back of Coach G laughing and joking for the entirety of my journey and none of them attempted to serve refreshments in First Class or even check tickets.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1
2018-04-28T10:27:07Z	Awful	I booked a train for 10am online the day before my commute as it is a lot cheaper but there was a technical problem and it booked the 7pm train. After I booked it and realised, I went on there again and filmed my booking process as proof I was not making this up and it showed there was a technical error and it was redirecting me to a different train time that I originally selected. When I rang East Midlands and explained it to the man on the phone he told me I was lying and the website wouldn’t do that, so I offered to email the video over as I needed to get on my train for work. The man on the phone gave me a fake email, and he also told me it would take 3 days for them to reply to me. So no matter what this wasn’t get resolved, he told me I had to buy another ticket which was £90 now as the tickets had gone up and there was nothing they can do about it. Even though I had proof this was not my fault and it was there website, he was rude and couldn’t care less that I had to get to work. I couldn’t afford to buy another train ticket so I’ve lost a whole day at work and had to pre book the train for the next day as it’s cheaper. Overall this was disgusting customer service and they couldn’t care, and they’ve lost me a days pay and now I’ve had to pay two train fares as well.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

Clearly done on the cheap.  Tiny, over crowded, often dirty and unattended with a poor selection of refreshments.   I now drive to Grantham or Newark to travel on East Coast wherever possible.  Often cheaper fares and first class rail travel as it should be.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

I had actually bought a ticket but left it on the train. They took it to court and the first thing I knew about it was a call telling me I owed the court £300+. Fantastic. They also charge extorrionate prices for a single ticket and NEVER give a discount, even to regular customers. They have a monopoly on my route so I'll be using coaches from now on. Literally the worst company I have ever dealt with, and trust me, that's an acheivement.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

It cost my partner £45.  We wanted to change train to an OFF PEAK earlier train as our flight came in early however to change to a train which would have been considerably quieter than the one we got on at 6 pm in rush hour was going to cost us an additional £30 each.  Its disgraceful how East Midlands trains can charge this to simply change your train.  Their staff are all rude and unhelpful, they clearly hate their jobs.  The trains always small and are dirty.  Awful company.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk	1

2020-08-07T10:14:54Z	Got a train ticket allowing me to use…	"Got a train ticket allowing me to use any trains to my destination, including return ticket using any route.I got to my destination without any issues.On my return, the ticket guy told me that my ""All Trains Allowed Virgin Ticket"" was to be used on any train EXCEPT Virgin trains.I was confused, and asked him to explain, he said that Virgin Trains sell tickets to many Train Providers, and my ticket was to be used by all other train Providers EXCLUDING Virgin Trains.I Was still confused, on why Virgin Trains would sell tickets to their direct competitors, it makes no sense. Even if this was the case, the Ticket would have to Explicitly explain that.How can a Ticket Bough on the Virgin Trains Website ""Giving Access to ALL TRAINS"" would EXCLUDE Virgin Trains. They have so much money, why not add this information as a ""Warning"" on the website when you are buying this type of ticket, and send an email containing this information. Isn't this very important? I explained to the Ticket Guy that this sounded like a scam, as by omitting this information they can get more money in fines from people boarding trains that they think that they are allowed in.I told him that I was sorry for the confusion and would leave on the next stop, as I don't care about the train that I'm in, I can just wait for another one. The Ticket guy didn't care, insisting and insisting and insisting that I would have to pay extra, treating me as a thief, a liar, and a criminal. Such a disgusting customer service, in the end, I paid for the Ticket Guy (just to avoid issues) and said to that Ticket Guy that I hope he buys a similar service from an Incompetent Company such as Virgin Trains, and have to pay extra for that service while being treated like a criminal.Such as buying a Ticket for Disneyland giving access to All Parks, and then be told that the Disney Ticket for All Parks would allow you to use any Amusement Park in the region EXCEPT Disney Parks. And be treated as a criminal, while being forced to pay a much more expensive price for that access to Disneyland even if you just said you can just leave the park, they will make you pay for the overpriced ticket.Ridiculous!   Disgusting!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2020-08-07T10:14:54Z	Virgin Trains when First Class just means a more expensive ticket	Booked to Virgin Trains from London to Manchester to take my son on a university open day. I booked first class as a treat but was wildly unimpressed. Didn't realise that weekend service is not half as good as the weekday service. No hot food. No alcohol. Not much point really but fair enough that was my mistake.On the return leg there was disruption and we were told to get on another train. There was no first class service. No hot drinks served to your table. No free bottles of water. Nothing just a larger seat. We were told we could go to the buffet car which was closing soon and pick up hot drinks and water for the remainder of the journey, which I did. But again this wasn't what I'd paid half as much again for. Somebody did come on at a later station but just handed us a sandwich and was gone, never to return. No water. No hot drinks.When you pay for first class, that is what you expect, and you pay a premium for it. I thought it would be a nice treat but I felt really disappointed. I complained to Virgin Trains but they basically said tough. They weren't interested in either apologising or offering me a partial refund. In fact, the guy treated me as if I was stupid, so he could move on to disappointing the next customer.I'm happy to pay for good service, but this was just a waste of money. Don't bother. And they don't care if you're satisfied or not. Richard Branson just puts his name on it and walks away as he doesn't care either, just as long as it's making him money.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2020-08-07T10:14:54Z	I went on a virgin train some years ago…	I went on a virgin train some years ago from Preston to Glasgow it was one amazing experience the train was at first over crowded but I and some others got moved and ended up on first class area and seating I had 2 free colas on the journey it was really relaxed comfy area not to many people there at all first class. The staff and the ticket inspector was absolutely outstanding brilliant really good nothing was too much trouble. The journey itself wasnt at all bad I had wifi and was be able to contact family and friends tell them where I was and I was on the train. All the staff was brilliant and kept us all informed on times and journey virgin train was clean tidy and comfy. I would definitely recommend and would use them again. I went to Glasgow to see friends on june 2016 setting off from Grimsby via Manchester then to Preston then from Preston to Glasgow long journey but with doing in my eyes I had to stay and get the train to Preston because of the thunderstorm we had on that day and the train lines were down but the journey was superb couldnt fault the staff on the virgin trains.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5

Had to ring their telesales. OK. The call cost me £12... as it was an 0871 number. Bad. They do something to make up for letting you down, then smear it in your face by charging a £1 a minute for the privilege of them fixing their own initial mistake. Shoddy.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2

2020-08-07T10:14:54Z	Paid £160 to travel from Glasgow to…	Paid £160 to travel from Glasgow to London. The most expensive fair, I discovered afterwards. I chose virgin because I liked the fa t the promote WiFi.The train had no WiFi, there or on the return journey. I selected my seats. When I got the tickets, there was no seats selected. Had to find a random seat there and back. Moving a couple of times. Exyremtly depressed there and back. Effected my whole London weekend mood. Would travel with the caledonian nights sleeper next time as its £90 only. Or the citylink bus from as little as £20 and it only takes and extra 2 hours.When I complained to virgin they said they don't promote the use of WiFi so I screen shotted all the promotional material available highlighting there on board services. When I proved this point with evidence he moved on to stating and ignoring me, not saying sorry. And talking about other trains that are being upgraded but in Wales, am in Scotland hahah I told him it's not relevant. They don't have a clue how to really deal with people simpley patronising people or making out one thing and lying about another. I hate this company and hope they go bust.

So bored of how bad Virgin trains are.This is becoming a recurring nightmare but in short, extortionate inflexible tickets, no seats, overcrowding, poor wifi, delays, poor service, dirty, smelly and regularly no way to pay for refreshments (card machine never seems to work and who carries cash these days).Someone needs to do something about it because Virgin aren't interested if you complain.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2020-08-07T10:14:54Z	I've travelled with Virgin 1st class…	I've travelled with Virgin 1st class from London to Birmingham on return tickets costing over £500, approximately 5 times this year (missed my train once and had to pay full fare hence the amount - I have no problem about the cost). Out of all these journeys I got served my allocated meal just once, as one of the staff had to go look in another cart that was from a previous service. 95 percent of the staff were rude and not knowledgable when it comes to food dietary needs. Stating that you have  a gluten free meals and then not being able to get one is abominable. Customer service has given me the same generic response twice in a row for the past two years and that is  not acceptable especially when compared to the quality of business they claim to offer or say they will strive to improve in the emails I've received yet for the past two years it only seems to have gotten worse.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

On arriving at Euston I went to ticket office to ask if I could reserve seats for return journey, but again was informed that they were fully booked, however the girl on duty spoke to one of her colleagues who arranged to meet us 40 minutes before train was due to leave on Sunday. He said he would do what he could to assist us find seats together.  We did meet him and true to his word he escorted us to the train and pointed out the carriages where we could find 4 unreserved seats together. Thank you for your assistance you are a true gentleman.

From London Euston to Lancaster we were informed that there would be no table service provided and that if we required refreshments that they would be available for purchase at the train shop.  The reason for the lack of 1st facilities we were informed that they had sold too many standard class tickets and as a consequence standard class passengers would be allowed to occupy 1st class seats.  ( Obviously the service staff are incapable of checking tickets). To compound matters as the train was leaving Preston station the new crew boarded and lo and behold it was announced that there would be no 1st class table service provided ,not due to the inordinate amount of standard class passengers there but because of illness.  Anyone else tried complaining about anything other than delayed trains?

2019-11-02T17:05:23Z	This is a copy of an e mail.	This is a copy of an e. mail i have sent to virgin trains complaints.I am writing to you to raise an issue about: Stoke on trent car parkThe issue that I have experienced was: I visited stoke on Trent station on the above date, while waiting for a friend to arrive. I am not familiar with this train station as i travelled from Yorkshire. I parked in the main car park, on entering there is no indication of the parking charges only that it is £ 12.00 to park all day. I exited the car park after 28 minutes after inserting the ticket in the meter and was disgusted to have been charged a fee of £12.00 which i find absolutely disgusting, as i have commented on entering the car park there is no indication as to whether there is an hourly charge, which is very misleading to say the least. or any indication that there is a cost of £12.00 whatever the parking period. I would like a full refund of 12 pounds for this what i will call a rip off, and certainly a very misleading information board at this car park. It seems to me that the information board is intentionally misleading for your customers as once parked we have no choice but to pay this exorbitant price. But reading online i seem to not be the only person that has had this issue at this station.A throughly disgusted customer.Totally disgusted at Virgin trains. I would expect better from a national company.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

He said ""fire away"" in an arsey way and replied ""I'm the service manager"".So is it ok for a service manager to speak to customers in this way.He also missed the couple next to us however they must have been too polite to question him - upon him coming back he served these first!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2019-11-02T17:05:23Z	Used to be better.	Virgin West Coast used to be okay (in my opinion) at least most of the time. The Pendolino trains were novel and service (especially First Class) was good.However travelling between Glasgow and Birmingham also London Euston on a couple of times this year has shown that standards have fallen somewhat.Agreeing with other reviewers, the weekend First Class service could be much better, it seems such poor value now.Most train operators in the UK have overcrowding and inadequate trains now, and I am afraid the Pendos are perhaps coming to the end of their usefulness. Even the 11 car units can get overcrowded at times, and there has always been a toilet smell from these trains - a system design fault.Virgin used to be the best of a bad lot, and I do worry First won't be great either based on the dreadful record when they ran the Scotrail franchise.I would have been sorry to see them go, but now I'm not so sure.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	3

2019-11-02T17:05:23Z	No sign of improvement	I have a long established account with Virgin Trains. Since my last review there has been no sign of improvement.  On the 24th October I was able to log in and got as far as booking my journey, but when it comes to paying the website stated there are problems and try later, which I repeatedly tried to do, at different sometimes getting as far as checkout sometimes not, but always being told try again later. This continued on the morning of the 25th  October when I got as far as booking my journey, but could not change seats or pay, told try later. I tried other web sites and it seemed they were experiencing the same problem. Went to my very helpful local train station, booked the same journey, first class, to be told no seats available!  Forced to telephoned Virgin booking line and booked my desired journey. What a farce.  No point Branson bleating on about being refused the franchise, when you have to phone Asia to buy a ticket. Only travel First Class to have a comfortable seat. Food served is rubbish, whatever the time of the day. No wonder our trains are being sold of to companies from around the world.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2019-11-02T17:05:23Z	Travelled to Windermere last Monday	Travelled to Windermere last Monday (21) and was on the 12.30 train from Euston to Lancaster, which was approx 17 minutes late. I missed my connection and had to wait one hour for the next train to Oxenholme; once there I had to wait another hour for the connection to Windermere. A two hour delay overall.  I am trying to claim for a refund and gave full details on the delay/repay form. The reply I received said it was my local train (to Liverpool Street Station) that was late and they passed my claim to Greater Anglia!! In other words they have either not read my claim about the 12.30 train from Euston or they are implying that I lied. Cannot get to speak to anyone at Virgin - why is that? What do people do if they do not have access to the internet?

2019-11-02T17:05:23Z	Incredibly kind staff	I'd like to thank the staff at Virgin trains for the amazing help they gave me on 9th Sep this year.  My daughter was terribly ill and without angels at each stage I hate to think how much she would have deteriorated.  My daughter suffers a rare serious illness.  She had gone to the lake district with her father and whilst there deteriorated considerably.  Thanks to her consultant's fabulous secretary at Gt Ormond St Hospital, I was able to speak directly to the consultant as a matter of urgency.  New drugs were discussed over the phone and a fax was due out promptly to the GP surgery to get these drugs so that I could rush to the lakes to give them to my daughter.  However immediately off the phone I learnt that I'd have to catch the 4.30pm train from London Euston to get to Penrith by 7.31pm and the last train back was 7.50pm.  And the only way to get the 4.30pm train was to leave straightaway from Potters Bar.  I rushed to Tesco Pharmacy who are always stars and know of her illness and they were able to give me a sleeve of medication trusting that the online prescription would follow in days.  Unfortunately at Potters Bar station the tickets issued were for next day.  In my panic I did not notice it.  I got to London Euston and stopped at a pop up information kiosk.  A very kind black virgin employee looked at the timetable and gave me more information about stops etc for the train due to leave in about 10 mins.  What followed now seems comical but not then!  I kneeled on the floor looking into my bag for something then realised my phone was missing.  I turned round to see the information kiosk where I must have left the phone but there was no kiosk.  I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I noted someone who appeared to be a virgin driver and rushed to him asking him if he knew whether there was a kiosk or had I imagined the whole episode to which he said they are pop ups!  Doh!  Funny now but not then!  There was no time to go to the ticket office.  The train was leaving.  I rushed to find another information kiosk and started to speak to a sweet young asian man only to hear in the background the earlier black man rushing to me with my phone that I'd left there accidentally.  I rushed for the train, 6 mins left by then for departure and the guard refused me entry as tickets were for the next day. I briefly explained I had urgent meds but she wouldn't have it.  I rushed to the sweet asian man and again briefly explained the urgency.  He ran with me, passed the guard and found someone on the train whilst I waited outside.  He wrote something at the back of the ticket and said all was good for me to travel.  How kind.The tall English woman he'd spoken to turned out to be a super star.  I was so worried as to how I'd explain to a ticket inspector that I was allowed to be on the train!  Well I didn't need to worry. Soon after the train left the tall woman came to me and said she'd found me and not to worry she'd look after me and reminded me where to get off and what train to get on and that there was a choice of trains for the return after catching the 7.50pm and that I should change at Preston where she would look out for me. She joked that I couldn't miss her for her height.  There was so much kindness from all. In a situation where there was not enough time to understand the whole situation, they sensed the urgency and trusted me and did exactly what needed doing to get the process moving. My daughter was too ill to come to Penrith station but her dad and my son came to collect the meds.  My daughter was insistent it was dad's holiday so I had to go back!! They continued their break and 2 days later she got her first respite and had a day of less pain and some sleep.  The tall lady came to me when I got off at Preston.  She kept her promise and made that evening so much less stressful.  That day was a very difficult stressful and sad day but once Virgin were involved that portion of the evening was made so much easier.  I wish I'd taken names but my mind was not in that state that day.  I would really like these staff recognised by the firm.  I hope the day and times help track them down.  The forecourt staff may remember me (short indian) bursting into tears when my phone was found!  My daughter's pain gradually reduced and for the moment she is pain free.  She has just started a natural sciences degree at Cambridge Uni.  I visited her 2 days back on Saturday and she looks so well and settled.  I couldn't help thinking how much that day when I rushed over with the meds how helpful the Virgin team were and Tesco Pharmacy and the team at Gt Ormond St Hospital.  All did their bit to help my little girl.  A big big big THANK YOU.  If somehow I could get the names of the staff involved I'd like to personally thank them.Best wishes always, Anju	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2019-11-02T17:05:23Z	Cattle style train journey	Currently sitting on the floor of what I would call a cattle styled train ride. Bum is numb as I write this.I paid £73 for a ticket from London to Glasgow (5hrs 3mins journey) as I had to attend a relatives funeral and I am sitting on the floor as there are no seats as there is an incredibly over packed train. Honestly is this what £73 gets you?I asked the ticket master how much it was to upgrade to First Class and she told me £107. Erm... what, I'm sorry. What a joke. Virgin should be ashamed of yourselves. Extremely appalling customer service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2019-11-02T17:05:23Z	Great customer service	Awful 1st class service, no tea or coffee was offered and vegetarian option was popadoms whereas non vegetarian was sandwiches. Absolute ripoff will not be using the 1st class service again.  Paid premium but in reality there is no difference to a standard ticket. Dont waste your money on 1st class. Avoid, staff are miserable too and dont want to try and help	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2019-11-02T17:05:23Z	Awful 1st class service	Travelling glasgow to london route via virgin trains several times this year I have to complain how cold the sir con is. I was more wrapped up inside than outside the train today. Travelling sept it was so cold that stepping of the train in coventry was like disembarking a plane abroad. Brrrrr put some heating on.

2019-11-02T17:05:23Z	Artic virgin trains	I was really put out of the lack of compassion and how rude the person in the London Euston ticket office was when I had a sick child and they could not help me get back or offer me a change of ticket that wasn’t going to be an extortionate price that I couldn’t afford to do it! Exclaiming I was just looking for a freebie! There should be something in place for exceptional circumstances when someone has booked an advance ticket and needs to get home sooner just to allow their child to sleep and rest when they are poorly. I was disgusted by the way I was treated.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2019-11-02T17:05:23Z	Disgusting service by Virgin trains…	Because of a catalogue of errors by Virgin Trains, my Fiance suffered financial loss and distress in relation to tickets purchased for a return journey from London to Ayr to visit relatives for her Birthday.The reason my Fiance suffered financial loss and distress is because the required number of tickets to travel were not issued by the ticket machine.Immediately this was brought to the attention of virgin trains - But instead of amending the booking, the customer service operative decided she should pay again! The refund made to my Fiance was about 18% of the total sum paid -because they only refunded for the tickets that she had received from the ticket machine for the first booking, not for the cost of the tickets that she hadn't received that caused the problem in the first place!I expected at the very least a refund of the total amount for the duplicated purchase and a payment in goodwill for the distress suffered. (she is dyslexic and has a learning difficulty and was crying like a baby, when she was told she can't board the train to travel.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2019-11-02T17:05:23Z	Because of a catalogue of errors by…	I have travelled on Virgin trains three times recently, each time I had a seat reservation, each time somebody else was in my designated seat, and insisted that they had a reservation. I had too find another seat and had to keep moving places when a passenger got onto the train and claimed the seat. One train was late over 30 minutes, but I cannot claim any compensation as the  'clerical fee' is too high, I will just avoid Virgin trains where I can from now on.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2019-11-02T17:05:23Z	Virgin trains just don't appreciate my custom.	Euston to Manchester. First class carriage packed but ok. Just about preferable to travelling standard bit It’s expensive for what it is. Staff wizzed through carriage flinging bacon sandwiches and bottles of water out. No plates and then rubbish sat for next hour and a half. What do they do all that time? Asked for decaf coffee, it never arrived. Come on Virgin, try harder.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2019-11-02T17:05:23Z	Sub standard first.	I wonder why there is a fancy menu put on the tables only to be told nothing available and because it is “ complimentary” then it is just hard luck. And then if you dare complain about it the staff are rude. Excuse me - I paid for a first class ticket so is it unreasonable to expect a first class service?  Virgin trains need to sort out their act.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	3
2019-10-16T15:33:52Z	Avoid Virgin Trains weekend 1st Class	I travelled on the 18:00 London Euston to Manchester Piccadilly Service, September 21st in First Class. Once underway, an announcement was made to advise that due to a ‘staff shortage’ there would be no First Class service on the 2 hour journey. We could get ‘a hot drink’ from the cafe if we wished. I didn’t want a hot drink and the reason I book First Class is to be ensure the seat side service (even the reduced one offered on weekend services). This is not the first time that Virgin Trains have not offered any service in First Class when I’ve travelled on the weekend and I suspect the ‘staff shortage’ excuse is just that - an excuse. What was the Train Manager doing during these 2 hours? Aside from checking tickets (once, despite several stops) I never saw him. I’ve been on weekend evening services before where the Train Manager has delivered the service. Why were we not offered the option of travelling on a different service and told before departure? My subsequent complaint was met with a litany of the other ‘benefits’ of travelling First Class and that the manager may have been helping other passengers. For 2 hours on a near empty service? My advice - don’t pay for a weekend First Class ticket on Virgin Trains. It’s something of a rip off.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

All the other operators except VIRGIN, yes except VIRGIN, said it was ok to travel even though the tickets would have not been the right ones for the diverted routes. The Virgin Train conductor said on the Birmingham stretch that the ticket was not valid and charged again!!!!! After hours of delays and the fact all the tickets were paid for with Virgin in the first place!  The train conductor even said ha ha you can claim back compensation.

Virgin train prices are extortionate so I would expect a much more pleasant experience. The carriages are always packed with many people standing, with seemingly only one member of staff walking down the train who is in charge of tickets and much more importantly, security. Not many train companies provide a service I would actually consider satisfactory these days, but Virgin are by far the worst. I have only ever had to get on Virgin trains due to delays and cancellations with other companies and I would never, ever willingly board one.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2019-10-16T15:33:52Z	Dont waste your money in First	If you even consider forking out for first class, check with Virgin Trains what actual meal service they offer. They advertise menus but are consciously cagey about the times they serve them. I have travelled at various times in the evening, as early as 7pm and get the “late evening” menu which is a pitifully small portion of cheese and biscuits or a tiny flatbread. You also get an extremely limited drinks service. Yet they are happy to take hundreds of pounds off you for the privilege. You only get a few soft drinks and cheap snacks in their over-crowded and tired lounges included. Let’s hope the new franchisees actually give value for money	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

Alcohol was immediately offered - welcome! - and soon after a choice of a pre-packed dry and poor quality meat and salad wrap, a small packet of crisps and some hugely calorific biscuits. On my table was a menu relating real cooked food. What was that menu there for? To rub it in that I should have diverted to Marks and Spencer at Euston to buy some real food? Just to suggest that some trains, somewhere and sometime, had real food in First Class??? I've always been a fan of this Virgin route but now wary. And just to make it worse last night, there was too much coming and going of staff, loading up water bottles, clearing tables, and generally invading the quiet space.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2

2019-09-23T09:22:58Z	OVERPRICED	I was on my way to uni, already dreading freshers week, and this train journey made me want to hang myself on Arthur’s Seat. We got on the (late) train at Euston with a swarm of impatient people and found our seats had been taken. But, being the lovely people we are, we just located another pair of seats as we were told by another passenger, and I quote, “it’s a free for all”. An announcement was quickly made to clarify that all reservations had been cancelled (apart from two OTHER coaches) so we thought that was the end of any trials (apart from freshers ball). But lo and behold, when we arrived at Milton Keynes, there was a rush of passengers on the train (the business is definitely result of the merging of cancelled trains- a you issue). A woman approached our seats and claimed they were hers, to which our neighbour explained that reservations had been cancelled, but no YOUR  TRAIN MAN TURNED AROUND AND REASSURED HER THAT RESERVATIONS HAD NOT INDEED BEEN CANCELLED. Not going to lie, VIRGIN, surprised that your staff are less informed than your passengers. (Also, he never even checked our tickets so we could have avoided the hefty price of your tickets and hitchhiked your stupid train.) We were then exiled from the coach into one of those connection bits between carriages where I sat on my suitcase a while until we realised we had to move as we were blocking the entrance to the train. Also would like to add that your wifi, while free, does not actually function- so you can IMAGINE the fun five hour journey to Edinburgh we’re having. Another announcement promised us seats further up the train, so we lugged our luggage and dignity to coach C, where there were still no available seats. Which brings me to now, where we sit on a pair of fold down chairs opposite your obnoxious speaking toilets, listening to his same stupid joke over and over again. Also, please invest in an “occupied” indication of some sort, we won’t always be here to man the lavatory I’m afraid.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

On the way to Birmingham Intl a train in front of us broke in Coventry, therefore my train couldn’t stop at Birmingham Intl and stopped only at Birmingham New Street with about 1hr delay. That’s ok, this things happen. We were told that our return tickets to London will obviously be valid departing from Birmingham New street. I was confirmed this again in the info point in Birmingham New Sterrt station. It seems today there were major disruptions so Virgin trains employees were aware of distressed travelers.On the way back, when I tried to pass my ticket by the validator at 5.05pm Today in Birmingham New street, an employee of Virgin trains did not allow me to pass by the validator because my ticket read Birmingham Intl. Virgin reassured me earlier that I should not have any problem as the whole stuff was fully aware of the issues and disruptions. This particular employee was rude and obliged me to run to buy a new ticket between New street and Internstional. Luckily I got the train at 5.10pm.

I asked for a cancellation of mine because my 8 year old Dog developed a cough last Friday. Virgin trains were useless. Wanted 72 hours to “verify phone call” then DISCUSS the situation. On the phone for over 30 mins then transferred to customer services whose automated service said they were not receiving calls! We couldn’t afford a “normal” ticket, single £189 from Exeter to Chester so he had to drive for 5 hours in his old car. He arrived @ 6.30 pm thus depriving us of an afternoon. Trip to celebrate husband’s 60th! More money will can I’ll afford. First family holiday for 12 years!

We phoned and asked if they could issue him with a new ticket as he was waiting at the station, but they said it would take 72 hours to verify our phone call (what?!!) Therefore he couldn’t get a train and join us on my 60th Birthday treat in Wales. Terrible!!!!Fortunately he decided to drive his very old Nissan Micra to join in the fun (5 hour drive).

No response several weeks later and I filled out the same form again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2019-09-01T16:19:22Z	Rotten value	Rotten value.  I have to travel 1st class regularly from Macclesfield to Euston because in Virgin's own words ''Madam, we guarantee you a train, not a seat'. So as not to have to stand for 1hr 40 minutes each way I have to buy a 1st class ticket.  Not paid for by some vast company, but by myself as I'm self employed.  Today's return ticket was £280 (and that only because my outward journey was just outside Peak time).  Or it would have been £400 return.  Say it out loud - FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS. £400 is only £20 cheaper than a return flight to Sydney btw.   On my return (35 minutes late) 19.20 train this evening we all had to wait 1hr 15 minutes to get even a drink, despite repeated tannoy apologies from the hapless catering staff.  The menu card on the tables detailed various meal options including a selection of hot dishes, soups, salads and the like.  Imagine our delight then to be eventually served a dull egg sandwich, or other meagre little snacks.   And crisps.  I asked wearily when proper dinner ceased to be served, and was told 18.40.   All throughout this nonsense the shop manager was on the tannoy reeling off the vast array of meals - hot and cold, that could be purchased at the other end of the train.  Which you couldn't get to because the train was rammed.  And just to add insult to injury, our crew were unable to serve any hot drinks on the entire journey as ''it takes a lot of background work and we've run out of time''.  How long does it take to boil a kettle, people?  Talk about rubbing our 1st class faces in it.  Virgin has us cattle captive.  Flying is much cheaper but takes as long and involves being attacked by the security sadists, and driving - forget it.  I hate this venal behaviour by the only transport option available to us.  Shame on you Virgin!  Know you couldn't care less but do you have to make it so obvious?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2019-09-01T16:19:22Z	Full marks!	Full marks!I had a problem with my travel on Virgin Trains West Coast Line recently.   This is the first time that I have needed to contact them and I have travelled with the may times in the past.  They dealt with the problem courteously and promplty. Therefore I am givomg then full marks.  At the time, it was very annoying to be so late in arriving and no food in 1st class, but bear in mind that this was the day after a major power cut and flooding problems in Scorland and I did get to my destination in time to celerate a family birthday.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5

2019-09-01T16:19:22Z	In all honesty	In all honesty, I don't use trains that often. Virgin trains have done nothing to change my mind in continuing using them.I placed three children on a train from Birmingham to Fairbourne, in Wales a direct route without changes.After calling on 5 occasions, I got five different answers, whether there was indeed a change,  in the kids having to swop trains along the line.1st Answer no need to change, which is what we expected to pay for.2nd Answer needed to change at machynlleth.3rd Answer at Birmingham international, needed to change at shrewsbury.4th Answer called virgin back, no need to change at shrewsbury, they needed to change at machynlleth now.5 Once the train pulled into Shrewsbury, the children where told to leave the train and change.I can't tell you the worry and distress Virgin trains has caused us today, they really could not care less. its just a call centre around the world, when you are trying to deal with a real situation.Would never use them again.Awful company, perhaps he should leave his island retreat and concentrate more on how his failing business is doing?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2019-09-01T16:19:22Z	1 star is too much for this company	1 star is too much for this company. I have to travel from Birmingham to London almost everyday for work. Extremely expensive tickets, rarely on time, bad customer service, overcrowded. Today I had to overpay a ticket as I wanted to be back on time as an urgent thing came up.... I got on the train without any delays, found a seat and I thought to myself that that's too good to be true... a few minutes later the train manager said that apparently they didn't have any train driver so we had to wait for someone. Seriously, we pay a ******** of money for tickets and they can't provide a driver???? And of course 45 minutes later the driver appeared.... was it really hard to let us know that he would be that late? We could have gotten in an other train within this 45 minutes.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

I say train I should say trains as we were kicked off at Milton Keynes and had to wait 30 minutes for another train (at least 3 Virgin trains shot through in this period).

They didn’t offer people free drinks despite passengers being entitled to them (I insisted on mine).Full on appalling.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2019-09-01T16:19:22Z	Extortionate prices, Disgusting Carriages and Militant, Jobsworth Staff.	Just awful.I dread the odd occasion I have no other choice but to use the train from the Midlands to London. When doing so, I know that I have no choice but to subject myself to the following:1. Extortionate.. as in absolutely outrageously, unashamed, eye-wateringly extortionate prices for tickets. Virgin know full well that people rely and depend on their services in order to get to work, and in return milk them for every penny they can possibly get. 2. An over-crowded, filthy, noisy and cramped carriage. At best your journey will be unpleasant.. at worst it is akin to being cattle loaded onto the back of a lorry. Absolutely foul. 3. Militant, hyper-jobsworth staff who patrol the carriages looking to pounce on any poor ‘customer’ who is unfortunate enough to have made the slightest discretion regarding their ticket. Within these disease-ridden walls there is no place for common sense, compassion or intuition, so do not expect any. Avoid like the plague. That statement sits on the border between being figurative and literal.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2019-09-01T16:19:22Z	Disgusting so called first class service	Doesn’t even deserve one star. Travelled supposedly first class from London to Liverpool last night. Severely over crowded carriages. People refusing to leave first class when passengers wanted their reserved seats. One young couple felt so-intimidated that they left train to wait for next one. No one checking tickets. When passenger asked for a coffee, so called hostess refused saying if she made one for them would have to make one for everyone! Couldn’t believe shoddy treatment to genuine passengers who had paid for first class service and we received nothing, no drinks or refreshments offered at all. DISGUSTING service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2019-09-01T16:19:22Z	Dishonest and exploitative aftersales tactics	Very disappointed with the dishonest 'aftersales' procedure for altering a ticket (off peak single) when mistakenly booked for the wrong date.Clearly designed to exploit people in a potentially stressful situation and squeeze out another cheap buck.When I had to pull out of a phone sale of a replacement ticket because I didn't have my credit card with me (Wolves-London, around £35, not available to download on the App), the operator charged me a £10 penalty in my refund for not booking the replacement through him.I then found a ticket for the same journey on the Virgin website for £24.40. Around £10 cheaper than the option given to me on the phone, even though the operator told me it was 'the best value for my journey.'It's a dishonest, bad-faith sales-driven approach, and is NOT customer service. Needs to be changed - leaves a very bad taste in the mouth and belies Virgin's advertising campaigns designed to portray dealing with the company as a stress-free experience.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2019-09-01T16:19:22Z	Poor customer care	Thank you for your letter of 26 July and the paltry reimbursement of £28.80 for the courier costs I incurred to recover my suitcase from Newcastle to Birmingham.I’m sure you were sorry to hear of my luggage mix-up and the inconvenience I suffered as a result of this. You could not have been as sorry as I was to spend 11 hours on 18th June ...a) trying to track down my suitcaseb) getting emergency medication (not easy from England to Scotland apparently)c) buying the bare minimum of toiletries, make-up and clothing for a 2-week touring holiday in Ireland.I hope you were also sorry that I was without my suitcase for 24 days from 17th June to 11th July, that I incurred more expense posting presents after the holiday, yet more expense changing Pounds to Euro and vice versa and yet more time and expense chasing up VIRGIN.  I heard nothing from you from 6th July, date of my first correspondence, to 26th July. An automated email to say you had received my correspondence and you were looking into the matter should be part of VIRGIN's ‘customer care’ process and is also common courtesy.I hope I never hear your ‘customer care’ helpline message ‘We’re sorry we’re not taking calls at the moment’ again. I hope I am never asked the same question; I had answered four times previously, again in Live Chat. In case you’re bothered, I have decided not to pursue compensation from NAME (aged 81, disabled, from Newcastle) for wrongly prompting your Station Assistance Team to take my suitcase not hers. Allegedly.You did get one thing right, however, your response was not the one I was hoping for.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

Always something broken on the train, seat booking system, toilet, air con, WiFi, shop card machine, seat tables, you name it it can break regularly on a virgin train. The Euston virgin staff experience? No better, act like security guards or bouncers, no customer service just authoritarian attitude. Once on board and all is working you are greeted to £1.30 for a pack of 70p crisps, £14 for a 4 pack of £4.50 beer and similar price hikes for everything from sandwiches to tea. All served with a frown. Also, if you break down don't expect any updates from the train staff, they arent the most communicative.  Look at any scoring site you wish, this company scores dire. These guys are basically running a literal monopoly on the West Coast line, you either pay their EXTORTIONATE prices or drive/fly.

2019-09-01T16:19:22Z	The worst train company I have ever had…	"The worst train company I have ever had the unfortunate to travel with!Their customer support can only be rated as a joke!Both my train services (outbound and inbound) to Glasgow Central from Euston were either cancelled or changed. I was supposed to arrive at Glasgow at 13:59 but ended up arriving at 15:30! Because I realized my original service had been canceled 2 days in advance (by myself since I got 0 notifications about it) I reached Customer Support trying to sort a way to board an earlier train in order to arrive at Glasgow before 14:30 as I had made plans already. They did nothing to try to move me to an earlier train, claiming it was due to engineering works and therefore the only option would be to buy a new ticket which would cost me around £190 per person! are they high on something or what!?? My nightmare wasn't over yet! Although the inbound service departed as scheduled, it took 80min more than the service I originally bought the ticket to, also due to the engineering works it had suffered changes.I filled in the delay compensation and surprisingly it was denied. After speaking with the ""useful"" customer support, they told me they had posted on their website that engineering works would affect services between Crewe and Warrington Bank Quay and that it was my responsibility to know whether those works would affect my journey or not. is this serious? do I have to know all the train scheduled stops and routes? I never felt so cheated by a company as of now! they advertised and sold me a train service that they couldn't fulfill, and when you ask their customer support for options they basically laugh on you! Well, I know a word that describe this behavior: Scammer!Avoid it if you can... If you can't I can only wish you good luck"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2019-07-28T18:25:48Z	10 hours of hell .....	Appalling experience on Virgin’s 12.49 Carlisle to London Euston service yesterday.  The scheduled journey was already over an hour longer than usual due to planned engineering works .... but in reality we ended up arriving  over 6 hours late due to signal and power failure issues of which there were too many to list! Finally arrived in Euston at 11.30pm. Paul, our train manager between Carlisle and Preston, did his best to provide regular updates with whatever information he could get but sadly his shift finished at Preston and the next crew were hopeless at answering any passenger questions or telling us what was going on. At Preston, they kicked us off the train as it had been rerouted back to Glasgow and so we had to transfer to another already packed train with standing room only. Obviously I’ll be getting my ticket cost refunded but this in no way addresses any compensation for passengers who had to endure over 10 hours of utter chaos.  I think I’ll be investigating the new service to Carlisle airport for future trips - and I bet it’s cheaper to fly too,	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2019-07-28T18:25:48Z	This is not 1 star bad this is 0 stars…	This is not 1 star bad this is 0 stars rubbish. We booked the new Caledonian sleeper and we get the old one because the new one has ‘problems’ and then we get a TWENTY POUND REFUND from each ticket, on the first trip the train sets off around the right time, each cabin reeks and is absolutely minging. I feel as though i totally nose-blind, I’m allergic to dust and get symptoms I’m having a reaction. There is rubbish left from the last person who slept in the cabin and the WiFi which we were promised was not there on either journey, there is no way to control the AC which makes noises, blows dust and disgusting smells into the room and it’s nist really cold, my cover smells on man sweat and the assistant button didn’t work so someone came into our cabin every once in a while and some played BBC radio 4 ALL NIGHT so i didn’t get to sleep... at all, apart from all this the assistant- or whatever they are- was really kind and cheerful and the breakfast was good.. on this particular journey. On the way back from London Euston on this train we had booked first class the lounge before hand only had a small selection of food, it was unkept and dirty. Then told us to board at a good time and then the train actually didn’t start until about way past 10 pm -3 hours later than we were meant to leave-, the reason for this i do not know why as to the fact we were never kept up to date and we weren’t even told there was a delay. Again inside the cabin my allergies had started, again rubbish left over from the last people were there, again i went nose-blind. Basically repeat the same things that happened last time (apart from the man sweat... well i haven’t got the courage to actually smell my bed sheets) but add on we were never kept up to date and then as expected we were four hours late getting into our station but were never told this by the assistant. I found out from someone else on board and then the worst happens. I have more allergies, eggs and nuts... we told the peeps this before. Yet they hand me a muffin with almonds and egg in it for breakfast  and i wasn’t eating the smoothie as it tasted utterly disgusting- so yes i starved . No never get on the sleeper train unless it is the knew one. And make sure it 100% is the new one until you book.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

Our seat reservations were a mirage, we had no hope whatsoever of getting to them. Unacceptable, dangerous overcrowding with no regard for passenger safety. We are literally unable to move in the corridors and people were standing in the interspaces between the carriages due to a negligent, incompetent train manager completely failing to limit passenger numbers - her replacement at Preston did actually understand what his job involves, and ordered the train to remain in the station until people got off. But by that time we had been on an overheated, dirty, unhygienic train carriage for 3 hours with the automatic voice message saying ""We hope you enjoyed your journey"" at every stop. No announcement as to how to get refunds, conflicting and sporadic info on alternative trains. Virgin you make me sick, literally, my poor daughter standing right by the inter-carriage door almost passed out from the heat and both of us having to perform gymnastics and contortions every 10 minutes to let people through to the buffet which they unbelievably continued to advertise as open, even in those conditions. They should have cancelled this service, it should have had 10 coaches but due to a set failure it only had 5, yet they still let the full number of people board. This was not a 5-minute tube journey, it was a high speed train from Edinburgh to London. Has this country learned nothing about the dangers of overcrowding? Air travel clearly far safer, the UK's rail network is not fit for purpose, just like its government."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

She genuinely made a mistake when purchasing her ticket with the date of her ticket. It was only when the train manager named Barry ( who wouldn’t give her his second name) pointed out her the mistake. He then rudely and obnoxiously spoke to her in a manner no man should talk to a woman. She paid the difference and he still came back a second time being abusive to her. The lady from the onboard shop came to her assistance and his manner changed. My daughter was extremely upset and her babies sensed this which made them upset too! This was disgusting behaviour showing no compassion or human kindness. I’m sure not what virgin trains would expect from their staff. I frequently use their service to Euston and will be changing my travel route in future. The one star I’ve given is for the lady from the onboard shop.

The Trainline website just directs me back to Virgin Trains and phone line refuses to put me through to anyone.Seems I’ve handed over money for no product and the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2019-07-04T22:02:36Z	I had a choice between virgin and chiltern- guess which is better	I had a choice between virgin and chiltern trains tonight. I decided to take a chance and book a ticket on virgin for the first time in ages. What a mistake.  On chiltern there are very few delays. This service had an out of order toilet and was delayed  by signalling issues.  I wish I had stuck with the chiltern tickets because although the service left later it will arrive at the same time due to the maladministration of this useless service. I will NEVER use virgin again.You shouldn't either	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2019-07-04T22:02:36Z	Aggressive Staff	Last September I used these to travel to London to visit the US Embassy. I had no issues with the price, the journey down was generally good, however by the time I got back to Euston my phone was on 2% charge and I'd forgotten to take my charger.I approached one of the staff, a man by the name of Surinder and tried to show him the e-ticket on my phone, but it died.I asked him kindly if there was any chance I could use a charger for enough time to show the ticket, but from the aggressive manner he had been looking at me I should have known this simple request would be a major issue.He basically told me that it wasn't his problem and to go and buy a charger. I told him that it was pretty obvious that I didn't have enough time and he told me to go away. I asked him whatever had happened to customer service and he basically tried to shoo me off like a dog. I found the supervisor and complained, but he didn't seem interested, so I walked to the ticket desk with Surinders evil look following me through the crowd in the station.When I got to the desk, the lady there Susan was most polite and kind and immediately offered me her charger, as well as offering to look after my phone whilst it charged enough to display the ticket.I went back after 15 minutes and the phone was charged, but then there had been a electrical fault on the mainline around Watford and all the trains were canceled, so a friend had to come and pick me up and drive me 90 miles back home.The service issues were forgivable. Susan was amazing, but Surinder is an aggressive bully and should be fired.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2019-07-04T22:02:36Z	Bad service and huge prices	I have travelled with Virgin Trains many times and had mixed experiences. It can be bit more reliable than other train operators but the bar isn't set very high. In general, I find it incredibly expensive. My latest experience with them was the worst. My boyfriend and I were travelling from London to Manchester and the underground took longer getting to Euston having to wait for a signal. Because of this, we arrived at Euston later than we were aiming for.  We were still a few minutes before the departure time and the train was still on the platform but staff did not let us pass. We were gutted. We didn't know that was even possible. We did not receive any warning that this might happen. There was no explanation, no apology. Nothing. We had to book new tickets, which cost us an absolute fortune. Once on the second train, we had to walk through every single carriage in the hope of finding seats. We were able to sit in two seats that no one had claimed at Euston. Probably someone else who had the same issue as us.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2

I waited for 7 working days, realised the money was not in my account yet.and I gave the customer service a call and they told me the money has been paid . I checked this on my bank statement and the refund was not there. I then called the customers service again, they insisted the money has been paid that I should check with my bank and i was given a long number  to give to my bank which I did, but my bank told me that there was nothing of such transaction on my account. I have called the customers service more than 2 times after that and they promised to investigate the issue and get back to me within 72 hours which am still waiting for their response. The worst thing is that, no one contact me unless I did. I believe they are not doing anything to resolve this issue and I am highly disappointed and frustrated. This is really unfair.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2019-07-04T22:02:36Z	Cattle truck to Glasgow.	The air conditioning does not work they have crammed everyone into one carriage. I found a carriage that was relatively empty. The seats were unreserved. Unpacked all my stuff went to sit down and suddenly the seats came up as reserved. Also there are no charging points nearby. It is hot and sweaty in here. Only another 4 hours to go. The WiFi is running at less than 0.3 Mbps.

Couldn’t find our tickets with train times, turned out we were on the wrong train 😬!The train manager, Chris, was so understanding!  He also helped me figure out what had happened and instead of asking me to pay for a full price he just asked for the price to update the tickets for me and my partner 🙌.

2019-07-04T22:02:36Z	STAFFORD TO CHESTER	STAFFORD TO CHESTER  Yes there was flooding on the tracks and yes it was understandably chaotic. Yes, all the trains from Chester to Crewe were cancelled BUT online the direct Stafford to Chester (Holyhead boat train) was still running.  When we got to Stafford we were informed the train had been cancelled too and eventually, after begging for help we were told to get to Crewe where there were bus replacements All in all the day was saved by a young member of platform staff at Crewe (young, dark hair and glasses - I wish I got his name tbh) who went out of his way to get us home - the other 3 staff we encountered at Stafford and Crewe couldn't be bothered helping or totally ignored us and another gave false information about 'bus replacements' which very nearly left us stranded for hours at Crewe or, having several changes at different stations (not possible)As it turned out, we ended up on the train we originally should have got on in Stafford! Not good when you have an elderly lady with you who has trouble walking (hence needing a direct train)All in all the journey itself wasn't too bad but the misinformation and the lack of information was extremely stressful and (as proven by one individual) unnecessary. 0 stars for organisation0 stars for staff attitude 0 stars for false online info0 stars for platform info5 stars for the guy who saved the day - a credit to Virgin but a shame the company and other staff let him downAs for letting Virgin know - there's no point	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2

2019-07-04T22:02:36Z	A joke too expensive to be funny.	1. So I've decided to invest in train tickets to avoid the 5h bus ride from London to Manchester. It's expensive but it's faster and I'll be able to work because there's WiFi! Or is there? You can definitely register but the network is inexistent. Not slow. Inexistent. If there's WiFi it means we pay for it, right? Then where is the service I'm paying for?2. I'm lucky, so to speak: being disabled I'm entitled to 30% off my tickets. Great! So I applied for a disabled person Railcard. Let's put aside the fact that I have to pay to apply (paying to get a discount, what a sweet irony), now I realise that no one even checks that I have it!! This means that anyone can just buy tickets at a disabled rate, without event being entitled to it, because no one is going to check if they have the corresponding Railcard... This is not a privilege, it is something we are entitled to because we have a disability. And knowing that anyone can take advantage of it is a slap in the face with a twist of disrespect.I'd laugh but my wallet won't let me.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

Dreadful Sunday service, poor service in first class with a very limited range of food and drinks coupled with lack of service. Declassification of train during trip resulted in first class and every other carriage becoming absolutely rammed with people with no reason given by the train staff.

Even though the ticket was purchased from Virgin on the Virgin App for use on a Virgin train service, it's not possible just to link the purchase with the repayment application.  You have to send the ticket image.)  This was rejected on the grounds that the ticket issued by Virgin was not a valid Virgin ticket.

As mum was the only person travelling in the 1st class carriage we thought she would be looked after. She was offered a drink as soon as she got on the train but she needed to settle herself down first so she refused it. No one came back to her to offer her a drink or food for the whole of her journey.

Even if the bag was removed how comfortable is the journey going to be now. I was literally forced to move myself into first class just to sit down. When explaining what was happening in standard seating I was met with a bill and zero sympathy or understanding.

2019-06-07T09:02:21Z	Terrible Service, Overbooked and Uncomfortable Journeys	I am a frequent traveller with Virgin trains on the London Euston to Glasgow Central route. It infuriates me how disrespectful and uncompassionate the majority staff are in stressful situations. I have had countless difficulties on these services but have no choice but to travel with this provider. Pretty much every Friday night service is full to the brim, which is understandable given that people are commuting out the city for the weekend. What I do not understand is why Virgin Trains are clearly incapable of managing the volume of passengers they have on a train. A great way would be not overbooking trains or limiting open ticket travellers? I can't see how sitting on the floor for the majority of a 5 hour journey is justified in the prices we pay. Not to mention the 'customer service' telephone line workers have been nothing but rude.If you can avoid travelling with this company- I would recommend. LNER on the other hand are far superior to travel with.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

You guessed; BMy husband who has Parkinson’s was almost passed out and unable to stand in a corridor even though we had booked a seat.

Another trip in first class with no hot food(someone called in sick, for which there is apparently no solution other than shafting people who paid extra for a hot meal.  How convenient for Virgin.  I heard Richard Branson threatening to shut the line down if he didn’t get his way recently.  Do me a favour Richard!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2019-05-09T08:16:56Z	appalling service first class London to Manchester	Travelled first class from London to Manchester on April 18, 2019 9:00 am. Am writing this review while sitting in the train. Horrible service and standards. The lounge offers almost nothing apart from a place to sit and stale bakery items for sample. I went out to have a breakfast. The guy who was taking the order in the train should at least be trained to smile if not  be polite. Seemed like watching a prison moving where prisoners are being served breakfast. Ladies serving the food were much polite and courteous.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2019-05-09T08:16:56Z	Train Your Staff	Just like others have said, staff attitude is truly appalling. Staff should either be trained to do their jobs properly or just find another job more suited to them. Went to board a train back to London at Birmingham International on Tuesday that left at 15:40. I had been at an exhibition and ran back with 2 colleagues to the platform. Arrived at 15:40 and 31 seconds to see the doors closing. Operative on the platform just kept screaming at us to step away from the train, which we did. I didn't bother speaking with him but I haven't experienced this before and expected at least a little courtesy - ignoring the fact that usually a train doesn't leave within the same minute it is scheduled to arrive and that in London a train would not leave passengers in this instance. Never the less, we accepted we had cut it fine but did not expect the screaming and complete disregard that we experienced.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

I discovered an app [Pedius Call] which allows me to phone organisations and have a conversation the way hearing people do, the only difference being my 'hearing' is via a translation provided in real time in text on my smartphone.I asked Virgin Trains if they would adjust their telephony to ensure calls using the Pedius Call app were not cut-off, a common problem with automated telephony.Virgin Trains pretended to look at the idea for a few months but ended up ignoring it altogether.Virgin Trains are simply refusing to provide deaf and hearing impaired people with the same level and quality of access to the service that hearing people have. I call that discrimination.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2

2019-03-11T08:19:17Z	Happy to take £396.00 from my account for tickets which they didn’t process and refuse to refund	Pretty good and reliable, comfortable trains, but sadly the titling trains make me travel sick! Staff nearly all lovely. Once you need a refund or anything, however, they really struggle. It seems the front of house staff are great, but their systems are poor.  Also, sorry, have travelled to London on Virign for years and years 1st class and the WiFi never works. Never an exaggeration, it usually gives you a minute or two before it cuts. Best stick with your mobile data!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2019-03-11T08:19:17Z	Pretty good and reliable; WiFi hopeless.	I rarely rate services, but this one is so shocking I thought I’d take the time. Being a daily commuter for over 3 years and paying over £900 a month to this ridiculously non customer focused monopolised company simply makes me angry. I can not say one positive thing about them other then they the only way to get you between the midlands and London in an hour. If I had any other reasonable choice I would take it, and If I didn’t have to commute daily I would rather spend the extra hour driving to London. Bad service, badly managed stations, overcrowded trains, dirty trains, overpriced, ignorant and rude staff, uncomfortable seats (if you can get one) ah the list goes on...!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4
2019-03-11T08:19:17Z	Avoid!!	Terrible experience every time used. Hugely overpriced fee for a shocking service with absolutely no regard for the customers. I had to work on my last journey on a Virgin train. I paid £3 for a Wifi service that did not work the entire journey and so I couldn't do the work I needed to do. I requested a refund and this was rejected. Virgin trains is hugely complacent in that they have dominated and monopolized certain train routes in the UK. Eventually, their complacency and lack of respect for their customers will come back to bite them. When this day comes, they will not be missed.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2019-03-11T08:19:17Z	Helpful employee	Really not surprised at all with the amount of negative reviews of Virgin Trains. Probably the worst service I have ever received. Having already paid for a return ticket from London Euston to Liverpool Lime Steet for 2 people, a mistake was made on the booking and the date of the return was a day out. Being too late to change online when I noticed, I boarded the exact same train I had paid for a day earlier with the hope that the Train Manager would understand and accept the ticket mistake. How wrong I was!The Train Manager clearly had no time to take into consideration the incident and instead charged me £190 for 2 tickets from Lime Street to London Euston!!! That is now on top of the £70 I had already paid for 2 tickets. Absolutely extortionate pricing from Virgin Trains. Do they genuinely believe their serice, comfort, journey time is of value for a price like that? Absolute scam and complete monopolisation by Virgin Trains.Rest assured I will not be using Virgin Trains again and quite frankly, it sickens me that I have filled the pockets of a company that does not care of its valued customers.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4
2019-03-11T08:19:17Z	Really not surprised with the negative reviews	If you want to travel with all the comfort and style of a Soviet troop transport, at the price of a first class compartment on the Orient Express, then travel with Virgin. Trains are always late. Trains are always horrifically overcrowded. Toilets are usually blocked. Trolley service can't navigate aisles crammed with passengers who paid for a seat but are standing. The bar is always understocked and the card machine never works. The wifi is always offline. And for this pleasure, you pay an eye-wateringly high price. True style and sophistication!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

Dissaponting yet hilarious when you read Richard Branson’s biography and he talks about the “Virgin spirit”.  He also talks about saving the environment and the price tags for each trip encourages one to use their own cars and hence contributing to air pullotion. Can someone please tell me how the price of £160 is justified for a train journey?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2019-03-11T08:19:17Z	£160 for a two hour journey?????	Try every other method of transport, even walking, before using Virgin Trains.  The Customer Service Department (ironically named, as they don't provide any) takes threats of going to government authorities just to get them to respond to an email, they offer the absolute minimal and enforced compensation that they can get away with and anything further will be a discount on future travel, ensuring that you use them again.

2019-01-18T15:18:26Z	Just brilliant Virgin Trains!!	My wife and children were badly verbally abused and intimidated on the last train from London to Liverpool last night, so much so that my daughter was crying and shaking with fear. My wife raised this with the train manager Stephen. An announcement was then made telling the passengers  abusive behaviour would not be tolerated. The train then stopped at Rugby and the police boarded the train. The man was asked to leave the train and refused, becoming abusive to the police officers. Eventually he and his friend were handcuffed and forcibly removed from the train. All the passengers in the carriage were frightened by this thug.So well done to Stephen and to Virgin trains for not turning the other cheek and sending out a clear message that loutish behaviour will not be tolerated.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5

So I gave up on using the service I had paid for as it was just too painful to try to use it.I have now just written to Virgin to ask for a refund of the £3 for the service I did not use and they are telling me that because I did not call them on the spot they won’t refund me.

2018-11-24T16:54:59Z	Horrible experience!	"Horrible experience.Getting from London Euston to Coventry on last Thursday(08/11/2018) was a nightmare.Leaving at 11:30pm the train was delayed and when arrived to Rugby, it just stopped. For 20 minutes stopped in Rugby at 1 in the morning, without any information given. After those 20 mins a Rugby station steward comes inand says ""This train is not going forward, you all have to come out and get on a new coach"".He saud some BS abiut our traain had to ""rescue"" another train... After 1h30 waiting in Rugby for a new train thee stewards say that a new train is not coming(?!?!) and that they would call taxis to get everyone to their destination(either Coventry, Birm. International, Birm. New Street or Wolverhampton).So we waited again for half an hour for taxis to come(at 3 am) to get us. The passengers going to the same place were going together and there was craziness going on, with people almost fighting forthe few taxis thatwere arriving.Finally, I managed to get into one and got to Coventry station at 3:40am, when I was supposed to get there by 1:13am. Absolutely ridiculous, no information given, lack of organisation... At least got 2 hours of sleep, before waking up at 6am ti go to work! :)"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2018-11-24T16:54:59Z	Out to charge you for as much as possible for and still not let you on their trains...but only sometimes?	"After purchasing an advance single from Euston to Birmingham New Street on a Friday evening for £15, the ticket staff pointed out my railcard was a month expired - admittedly my own fault.  I pointed to the next warden on the train and asked to pay the difference for a new ticket (was told around £10).  By this point there were huge queues to board the train and I was happy to pay the difference to board promptly but the warden then told me to go to Euston station ticket office and renew my railcard.  I objected because this is not something that can be done in the 10 minutes before the train leaves.  She then said I have to otherwise I will have to buy a whole new ticket ""which is about £50"".  I asked about paying the difference as the previous Virgin Trains staff member told me but was refused this option and told again to go to the ticket office.After going to the Euston ticket office I was told what I already knew that I cannot renew my railcard without a passport photo to go with the form which has to be submitted.  In the end I had to purchase a ticket for the next train 20 minutes later which was also £23 instead of the ""about £50""  Virgin Trains staff had told me.Ultimately the train was delayed by 16 minutes, was overbooked because I and about 15 other passengers had to sit in the mid-carriage by the toilet and conveniently didn't have a single ticket inspector before, during or after departure.  This serves as insult to injury because of the sheer inconsistency of staffing, that I could theoretically have walked onto the 2nd train with no ticket and got away with it yet after paying for an advanced ticket but missing the prerequisite valid railcard I was forced to play a hand of overpriced options or denial from the train.  It is also intensely aggravating that tickets are non-exchangeable or refundable for what feels like absolutely no reason but to inconvenience the customer into spending more money.This whole experience has exposed Virgin Trains as another corporate unit to milk people of their money in whatever way possible.  They may boast the quickest trains to Birmingham in adverts but I'm definitely waiting an extra hour and paying 1/3 the price for a coach from now on.  In addition, should a Virgin Trains staff member read this I would like to be contact for an explanation of refund and exchange policy and why I could not refund my ticket."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

I had requested a forward facing seat but had my back to the engine in yet another seat with restricted leg room ( I'm only 6'2). On the plus side, both services left and arrived on time.

But, instead of arranging buses they insisted on us waiting over 2 hours for the train lines to be cleared. Instead of 2315, we got in around 0230. This meant no onwards travel options, and the cost of a taxi, as well as minimal sleep on a work night. Needless penny pinching at great inconvenience to customers.

Still waiting to hear back regarding cancelled journey Glasgow to London due to Storm Callum on 13 October 2018. I've had an account with Virgin Trains for years now and book all my tickets through this system. Why do they insist on copies of the ticket and proof of address when they have all this on their systems? A delaying tactic I suspect. Although I should be grateful for refund of a delayed journey, I don't appreciate having to knock their doors to remind them each time compensation is due. The auto refund option is a gimmick and I have never experienced it to work. I've had to claim compensation with proof of purchase and proof of address each time.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2018-09-23T12:09:55Z	Disgraceful customer service virgin	During the recent storms, virgin trains failed dismally in its customer service. Their trains were canceled on the London to Glasgow route, and we got stuck in Preston. Virgin announced a couple of hours later that no further services would be provided that day due to high winds and storm activity (including buses), which then left us all standing on the platform freezing cold, not enough seats for the many elderly holiday makers, and as we had been told to wait and see, many of us stayed instead of returning to London, which was the only option offered by virgin.  My husband during this time walked a quarter of an hour up the road and purchased 2 bus fares to Glasgow, his only problem was hoping he had got there in time before all the seats sold out. So clearly, it was possible to run buses to Glasgow. My question to virgin is - was it a complete lack of organization and customer service that caused this catastrophe, or was it more of a financial consideration. Much easier to refund those people who apply on line(this process takes 28 working days for virgin to consider your claim before refunding it, if they actually approve it) although many of us were overseas travelers who probably won't even be in the country by then! The other alternative was to take your receipts in to their office, again a very impractical solution for those of us who are traveling holiday makers.  Given the difficulty in actually trying to get refunded, many people would just give up and not bother. This would be a very convenient situation for virgin, they don't have the costs of buses and drivers, and taking their chances with the number of people who actually try to claim back their out of pocket expenses (which virgin has the final say on whether they are approved or not) all leads me to think that this is how they operate. VERY POOR EFFORT VIRGIN, leaving a train load of passengers ( many of whom are clearly elderly holiday makers)stranded in a country town, freezing cold and having to stand because there's not enough seating. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE WE HAVE EVER COME ACROSS.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2018-09-23T12:09:55Z	Virgin Trains are a total disgrace	Virgin Trains are a total disgrace. My fond wish is that when it comes time to renew their franchise, they are refused. My wife was travelling to London last month, and booked her ticket on line. It did not arrive on our home computer until (would you believe?) twenty minutes AFTER the time for the departure of the train. She had all of the other papers proving that she had paid (first class, as well) but was still not allowed on the train. So she had to wait on a freezing platform for an hour, and only avoided paying again because a kind-hearted member of the staff noticed she was in tears and asked what was the matter. He probably got sacked for showing sympathy for a customer, when it was Virgin’s fault.I made a complaint about this and was told (by email) that we would get an answer within 14 days. Twenty three days later I followed this up and was told by a female called Eve that I didn’t receive such an email, and that they guaranteed to answer complaints within 28 days. She could not understand that since they need twenty eight days and the complaint had been sitting unattended for twenty three of them, it was unlikely anything would happen. She said since I had telephoned (one of their automatic switchboards gaily announces “We’re not taking calls today.”) she would pass my complaint to a senior colleague.

You have to repeat your issues over and over again and staff are difficult to understand and they struggle to understand the nuances of the English language. In every occasion they put you on hold while they consult ""their manager""- probably an excuse to run up the cost of the call.

AND I was right next to the crew cabin so not asking them to go anywhere - I sat and had my dry roll while waiting for the next ration!As someone who works in customer service the lack of “that little bit extra” really riles. Fortunately I’m traveling back on a Saturday so will just bring my supplies on board and serve my self - certainly more likely to be closer to first class!

2018-09-23T12:09:55Z	My worst experience yet	"Just completed my journey from London to Manchester - usually I've had no problem with the service. Started on the wrong foot by missing my train at 7.20am - mind you by two minutes - from which the general sense I got from the staff is ""you snooze you lose."" In case you're wondering, I didn't oversleep and miss the train. Apparently the best the man at the ticket office could do was for me to pay the difference of £50+ for another ticket even after a rather humiliating confession about the reason for my trip up North. Low and behold, when I checked online, there were cheaper alternatives for later in the day. What's a girl to do? I picked my dignity off the floor and booked a new ticket on my phone. I wasn't expecting a free pass mind you - just to be treated with a bit of compassion or maybe if that wasn't part of the service I would have hoped at the very least they would be helpful to customers and not try and rip me off on price. So that was the first hurdle. When I finally got on the train - initially it was warm because I think the heating was on. But this didn't last as we started to move. For such a dreary and wet day it isn't surprising there was a slight chill in the air. When the ticket man came to my carriage, I did something I don't usually do, I tried to make light of the situation and ask why the heating wasn't on. He asked me why I wanted the heating on. I said it was cold. He didn't respond so I thought I needed to justify why I was feeling cold so I said I was unwell (I'm actually taking antibiotics at the moment so completely true). To which he responded that I should walk up and down. Then he moved on to the next customer. And I stayed shivering in my coat. Maybe I'm being unreasonable but it had to be written. I hope for a better service next time."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

It's almost embarrassing to try and stop them with a query when they rush past. This isn't the first time the services are so bad. It's been going on this way for years now. Virgin management can't be bothered since they hold the monopoly on train travel between these regions.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2018-08-23T21:25:55Z	virgin out to charge you twice	Purchased tickets on line and then printed at the station the day before and the time on the ticket said 6.35am. Got to Chester station to be told I had missed my train as I should of been on the 5.50am as the time on the ticket was my connection at Crewe! What madness to put the wrong departure time on the tickets so I had to pay another £103.00. The guy in the ticjet office said it happens 20/30 times a day and it’s virgins way of ripping off its customers and feel embarrassed by what they are doing.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2018-08-23T21:25:55Z	I had a big suitcase which was…	I had a big suitcase which was difficult for me to even drag  so I asked for help from one of the staff standing outside the carriage. She said I ain't carrying that and muttered to herself as well as talked in a rude manner and pulled a bitchy look. It's completely understandable that she couldn't pull it to the carriage but my question was could you please help me not can you carry my suitcase. She took it out of context herself. Then I asked if she could just keep an eye on it while I looked for someone, again she pulled a look didn't even reply and just turned the other way. She did hold it while I looked. The attitude and disrespect was awful her non verbal language also. The man who checked my ticket said oh you're struggling then he pointed that lady out as if to say ask for assistance that is what I did and payed £150 for first class service to receive that terrible customer serviceThe manager was unhelpful and said use the website if you want to complain no apologies given nothing except he said it's not their job to help with baggage, well thanks for that it's not her job to be rude either. My complaint is not about refusal of carrying baggage at all When I got off the train I was struggling and my dad was coming to help from ten other Sode of the platform. I was holding my suitcase as it was very heavy and the manager was staring at me and then said stand behind the yellow line that's what It's there for isnt it he smirked and walked off. Thanks for watching me struggle and walk off smirking even after you knew I was upset from staff behaviour. He even shaked his head in a cocky wayNever again. I am going to take it further Make sure you complain if you have had bad service so more of this negativity is recognised and solved	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2018-08-23T21:25:55Z	I had missed a coach due to a last…	I had missed a coach due to a last minute timetable change, that I was not informed of. The coach journey was from Preston to London, and I had to make a coach connection at Warrington. The agents at Preston bus station arranged for me to catch the train to Warrington, so I could catch up with the bus. So I caught a train from Preston to Warrington, but unfortunately the train had to stop near Coppull, due to another train further down the line breaking down. This resulted in me missing the coach connection at Warrington. At this point my holiday was off, and I didn't have the money to pay for a single fair to London. I complained to a member Virgin train staff at Warrington train station. The member of staff  fully understood the nature of my complaint, and what had gone wrong.  The member of staff at Virgin trains contacted  the agents at Preston bus station, and through numerous phone calls between themselves, resulted in me catching the train to London Euston. I have to say I was very impressed with the way the staff dealt with my problem especially when she was dealing with other customers at the same time. I have got her to thank for sorting out a ticket for me with the agents at Preston bus station  on Friday 30th July 2018 at12.09 pm. Her name was Leslie, and I can't thank her enough for her help in ensuring I arrived at my destination and was able to go on a much needed holiday. FIVE STARS FOR EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2018-08-23T21:25:55Z	An absolute disgrace @virgintrains @ncp @birminghaminternationaltrainstation	An absolute disgrace @virgintrains @ncp @birminghaminternationaltrainstation my wife and I arrived at Birmingham International Train Station tonight the 07/08/2018 at 20:20 as per my ticket below. We were going to find out some train departure/arrival/connecting information and was not sure how long it would take. As the short stay car park was only a 20 minutes stay we decided to park in the main train station car park. Once we found out the information we put our ticket in the pay machine. The price came up on the machine at £12 and the time that we had been in the car park stated on the machine was exactly 20 mins. We obviously thought that this was a mistake and tried the ticket again but again it stated £12. Thinking it was a mistake we pressed the call button on the machine but it just rang out. We could not see the tariff explanation for the car park anywhere. After several minutes we decided to drive to the barrier thinking it maybe free for a 20 minute stay the same as the short stay car park or that we maybe able to get some assistance. When we got to the barrier we put in our ticket and yes you have probably guessed it came up with a charge of £12. I pressed the help button on the machine and after a short wait we finally got through to a man at the end of the phone and explained our issue. He said that the charge is set by Virgin not NCP and that it was correct. In disbelief I asked where this charge information was shown because I do not believe that I or anyone else should pay £12 for a 20 minute stay especially as I am getting information and looking book tickets with Virgin. He asked me if he could put me on hold and that he would come back to me shortly. After several minutes on hold I was cut off. When I pressed the button again after another wait a man answered this time I took his name Liam, once again I explained the situation and he said I think I know who you were talking to but then gave me the same spiel as his colleague. I asked to speak to a manager or supervisor again I was put on hold and again after 5 minutes cut off.  It is obviously a joke to these NCP employees to cut people off when they can see that customers are not particularly happy and want to add fuel to the fire. I tried again but again got fed up of waiting for an answer and decided to pay the ridiculous fee. To summarise we arrived at 20:20 put our ticket in the machine at 20:40 to pay and leave and finally departed at 21:00 after being messed around by some poor excuses for staff. Not happy and certainly not impressed. I thought @RichardBranson was an entrepreneur not a RIP OF MERCHANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BE VERY AWARE OF THE TRAP SET BY VIRGIN TRAINS AND BIRMINGHAM INTERNATIONAL TRAIN STATION. Just for clarity I am 41 years of age and am more than capable of paying the £12 but it is the shear principle for me. Rip off scams like this should not be aloud or accepted by anyone. I have never left a review or made a compliant over the internet like this before but you can probably tell by my tone I am disgusted!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

Customer service is beyond appalling.I bought tickets two weeks ago, using their Best Fare Finder online only to discover it was not in fact the Best Fare; a Family Fare was avaialble for the same journey for considerably less money.I then began trying to contact Virgin about this.Phoned them...no answer, automated message saying to use Live Chat...tried that but again no response.Tried Facebook who advised leaving my number and customer service would phone me back in 24 hours.I did this...no response.Tried Mesaagjng them today...was told they will phone back “sometime” but can’t provide a response time...but it is not within 24 hours.It is beyond frustrating, they are just appalling.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2018-08-23T21:25:55Z	The reservation for the train that Virgin knew never existed.	When I arrived at the station I had the shock of discovering that the Virgin Trains website had reserved me a ticket for a train that was not scheduled to run. To make matters worse when I sought assistance from the station staff they informed me that Virgin Trains must have been aware of this situation for quite some time, because no trains had run on the particular route I was due to travel on for several weeks. Despite having had almost a month since I purchased my train tickets to rectify the situation by contacting me to make alternative travel arrangements, Virgin Trains had done precisely zilch. Accordingly, I decided to write a letter to their customer service team to flag up this issue in order to enable them to conduct an investigation with a view to contacting other passengers who were yet to travel and would be likely to be affected by this issue. However, despite having waited longer than the 10 working days specified on their website to date I have yet to receive so much as an acknowledgement of receipt of my complaint. I think this speaks volumes about their attitude to customer service and following this experience I will be going to great lengths to avoid using their services again in future.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2018-08-23T21:25:55Z	Useless	"Useless, obstructive staff at Euston, and an equally useless refund service. They don't want you to contact them, e.g. phone line constantly says ""we're not taking calls"", and now they're completely ignoring my emails, so I've warned them it will not go away. 3 months on and still no refund; bunch of incompetents. I'm being polite but Branson's business fills me with anger. They're very quick when taking money OFF you. A higher authority needed now - the ombudsman?UPDATE: Finally received a reply in the post, which seems to have taken over 2 weeks to be delivered! They are saying it's the customer's responsibility to check their mistakes, but have sent me a travel voucher ""as a gesture of goodwill"". I didn't want a voucher, but a refund into my bank account, as I made clear to them. And it's very restrictive: at least 14 days' notice if booking by phone, and you can't use the voucher online: well I book 95% of train tickets online. Am I totally happy? NO. When I think of Virgin employees, the initials of the Football Association are now firmly associated with them. Contrast VT with WM Trains, who, after a train delay, paid a full refund into my bank account by the end of the week. You have to stand firm against big organisations. It helps to keep a picture in mind of Branson sunning himself in Necker Island, at the public's expense."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2018-08-23T21:25:55Z	Another bad journey with Virgin Trains.	Another bad journey with Virgin Trains.I had a ticket from Leeds to London King's Cross. As soon as I got onboard I found out my reserved seat was already occupied.I had to look for some crew members to get to know that they had issues with the reservation system.Not only that, but the AC was not working in a number of coaches, so the train master suggested customers on those coaches to move where the AC was working before the next station.I've seen many customers coming onboard and not be able to seat in the coach where they reserved a seat.Complaining on the virgin trains site is very long and unnecessarily complex. Even if you're using their app and have all of the details about your journey there, you can't just fill a form on it: you'll have to get to their site and start a lengthy and irrational process.So here is my complain: not worth the trouble.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2018-08-23T21:25:55Z	Customer service without even asking for any!	My daughter and I recently returned on a Virgin Train West Coast route from London Euston. The train was very overbooked and we voluntarily disembarked before the train left the station—deciding to wait until the next train we could take on our tickets (an almost four-hour delay as our return tickets were off-peak only).Nichola from the Virgin office at Euston Station notice we had left the train, she followed us and asked us why we had disembarked. Then she very kindly organised us new tickets to travel during peak hours on the next train and ensured we had good seats.It was impeccable, forward-thinking and thoughtful customer service on a very busy and fraught Friday afternoon.I am a regular Virgin traveller but there was no way for Nichola to know this. Thank you Nichola and thank you Virgin. You changed the day... as you often manage to do.

2018-07-01T23:59:24Z	Brilliant disaster preventing customer service	I got onto the wrong train as I arrived at the platform at Preston station late... I got onto the train heading north to Glasgow instead of the one I needed to get onto going South towards London... I only realised when I saw that the train wasn't stopping and according to my train tracker I was meant to have already passed my stop at Wolverhampton... upon enquiry I learnt that I was indeed on the wrong train and when I consulted with the train manager I found out that the next stop was Glasgow and that would have been the last stop for the day... I didn't have enough money for anywhere to stay overnight or to get a train ticket in the morning from Glasgow... however I was delighted to find out that the extremely helpful lady, the train manager, had pulled a few strings, made a few calls and arranged for train to stop at an earlier station AND for a train going the other way to make an impromptu stop at the station for me the switch trains and provided me with a FREE customer service ticket as the means for my transport the following morning... although the train wasn't going all the way to my destination due to the time of day, the train stopped at Preston where the members on the platform reassured me for my transport the next day which was faultless as well... was my first time I used the service last November and I will always appreciate the great act of kindness by the Virgin trains workers...

2018-07-01T23:59:24Z	I am shocked by how incredibly bad the staff is	Worst experience I ever had on a train journey.I took a Virgin train from Chester to Crewe, which was delayed and made me miss my connection on the West Midlands train.The staff at Crewe station (Virgin staff) told me that I could get on the next train (which apparently was a Virgin train but I didn't know), because it wasn't my fault that I missed the train, since the train made me miss my connection.I followed the advice, as I'm just travelling through the UK I'm unfamiliar with the train system. So if you happen to be a tourist, stay very far away from these trains, if you don't know the train companies thoroughly and rely on their staff to give you information, well good luck.The staff on the Virgin train to London was absolutely awful. They denied that I could get on their train with another ticket, questioned me for an hour and made me repeat what I was told in Crewe numerous times. I felt I was being treated like a criminal when all I did was following their staff's directions. They had an aggressive tone with me and implied over and over that I was a liar. They still wanted me to purchase a second ticket, which makes me wonder why they asked me to repeat my story 8 times if it didn't matter to them anyway.People make all kinds of mistakes when taking trains, I expect some decency and respect when that happens. The staff was biased, implying that they often have people telling stories about why they don't have a ticket, so I must be one of these people as well. They could've contacted the staff that was responsible for giving me the wrong information but they didn't.Now they are not replying to my complaints.So to summarise: the Virgin train made me miss my connection. The Virgin staff at Crewe told me to get on a train that I couldn't get with my ticket. The Virgin staff on the train to London questioned me excessively, for no reason apparently, as they still wanted me to pay for a new ticket anyway. Now I'm not getting any response from Virgin, which leaves me unable to collect the evidence I need in time for my appeal.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2018-05-26T11:35:19Z	Unfair pricing	Terrible pricing. I bought a ticket for £20 and to change it to the one 15 minutes earlier to ride with a friend required me to apparently get a completely new ticket - for £80. We travelled separately just to see how empty the trains were. Terrible corporate feeling with unfair pricing.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2018-05-26T11:35:19Z	Consistently poor	Regrettably I use Virgin trains a lot for work, commuting from Kings Cross to various parts of the country. The outward journey is usually ok, however when returning back to London in the evening, I have not once been on time. The delays and long pauses are consistent with Virgin Rail. By contrast contrast when I have travelled with Midland Railways, no issues at all. Try to avoid Virgin!!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2018-05-26T11:35:19Z	E-mail sent to Mr Branson and Co	E-mail sent to Mr Branson and Co I am contacting Mr Branson  and his management team in a desperate attempt to extract a refund of £25 on behalf of my impoverished student son.  £25 is undoubtedly not a huge amount of money to any of you who will be earning lucrative city salaries, but to my son,  it is  a sum of money he is rightfully entitled to and which he can use towards his ongoing extortionate travel costs   I`m sure Mr Branson (who is probably sunning himself on Necker Island, carefree and oblivious  to  the harsh reality  of 21st century   living)    must be able to  spare five minutes of his valuable   time  to attend to this matter and arrange to expedite this payment, or failing that any of you on the management team surely must have authority to sanction such a small payment?? I can`t believe that something so simple to deal with is causing my son such  a huge amount of stress and frustration. Virgin, you must do better and you can start by making this repayment without further delay.RegardsChristine McIntyre	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2018-05-26T11:35:19Z	Had the misfortune to travel 3 times…	Had the misfortune to travel 3 times with this company and every time I have been let down. Most recent was travelling to Liverpool Lime Street from Shrewsbury with a change at Crewe. Unbeknown to myself Liverpool were playing Roma at Anfield on the day I travelled and being disabled I am unable to stand for any length of time despite the fact that a seat had been reserved but was unable to use it. Virgin train dispatchers are rude and insensitive to people with mobility issues, the final straw being oh well if you had arranged assistance in advance we could have helped you. Having done this on previous travels with this company where assistance was conspicuous by it s absence or so grudging that you feel as though you are a nuisance. Sadly, I'm due to travel to Blackpool to a conference in a weeks time and guess which train company I've got to make do with, yes Virgin again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

Initially, they claimed it would take up to 15 days to respond, 45 days later I received a response saying they had a large number of emails to process. I received no information or help from the company.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2018-05-26T11:35:19Z	When I looked at the reviews for Virgin…	When I looked at the reviews for Virgin Trains on Trust Pilot, it confirmed that my own experience with this pathetic company wasn't a 'one-off'.It's a couple of years ago now, but my wife and I paid for reserved First Class seats from Warrington Central to London Euston only to find our seats occupied by a couple who steadfastly refused to move.We looked for members of staff to sort the situation out, but they'd all scarpered and stayed hidden!When I wrote to Virgin to complain, we received a £25 discount voucher off our next trip, which I immediately returned. I informed them that I didn't WANT another experience like the one we'd just had and asked them what system they had in place to ensure that people who pay their sky-high prices actually get to sit in the seats they reserve.As you may well guess, I didn't hear another word!....happy to take our money and provide a third rate so-called service in return.I haven't used Virgin Trains since and I absolutely refuse to put money in Richard Branson's pocket by using ANY of his companies. If there was any fairness, Virgin Trains would have its contracts revoked.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2018-05-26T11:35:19Z	Paid  £120	Paid  £120 Sat on the floor next to the toilet with 5-10 other people in the same space. You know how many seats are on a train, you can see how many people will be left without seats on a 2 + hour journey.  Within my restricted view inside one cabin, I could see 16 people standing or seated on the floor.Baring in mind my ticket was £120, and the person sat on the floor next to me paid £70, a month in advance. let's say the average would be £90 That is £1440.00 you have taken off people for that! What an absolute joke.Not to mention, this trip was actually a very last minute one to go and see my sick father in the hospital. You should be ashamed	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2018-05-26T11:35:19Z	Virgin what has happened to you?	"A very bad experience with Virgin staff who were less than helpful. After waiting 2 hours in the freezing cold station at Glasgow where actual snow flakes were coming through the roof our train back to London Euston flashed up cancelled. I asked the Virgin staff what should we do and the only advice given by a truly fed up female member of their staff was to download their train app and twitter for live updates. When asked but we are now stranded the female shrugged her shoulders put her arms out and said frostily ""nothing I can do""! We were ""abandoned"" for 4 days without an offer of them finding accommodation, food or drink.....yet they had a duty of care which they failed dismally to provide. Their tweets advised each day that trains would leave Glasgow yet when you looked on Euston they were ALL cancelled and I had to tweet them to say their live updates were in fact incorrect. We discovered by mere chance they were starting to bus passengers from Glasgow to Carlisle where trains were now running ....this information was on Teletext but not Twitter! So the following morning (day 4 of being abandoned) we drudged our way down to the station in the snow at 7.00am without breakfast or a hot drink. We expected a notice to advise passengers we expected a member of Virgin staff to be on hand but there was no one! I had to ask the ticket sales manager who advised connection buses were laid on yesterday but Virgin staff didn't want to make it public as they would be unindated instead it was by mere chance if passengers found out.....shocking! This was infuriating to say the least as we could have got home a day early saving the added expense of a night's accommodation, food, drink not to mention our 2 dogs who had been stuck in kennels. The bus turned up shortly after 8am and we were ushered on to it. No provision of hot drinks or food which could have been provided by Virgin as nearby food outlets were open. We travelled to Carlisle station where on the platform there were a handful of Virgin staff in a huddle keeping their distance from the passengers. We had to approach them for advice. We purchased our own drinks + food from the nearby kiosk but again no offer from Virgin despite their passenger charter of providing refreshment and food where possible....well it was possible! On the train to Preston the buffet car was shut due to passengers sitting on the floor....the train was rammed. We had to change at Preston to catch another train to Milton Keynes. And it wasn't until we had just left Birmingham that food was finally provided.....unfortunately no hot drinks as the boiler had broken! It has taken 55 days to get a reply to my complaint and to be reimbursed for accommodation only apparently on this occasion they are not reimbursing food and drink....How do they expect us to be stuck with a bill out of our control whilst in their care?! I might add I had to chase the reply up on numerous occasions .....online chats as Virgin obviously don't have human beings that can talk on a phone! Managers were apparently always in meetings leaving their staff to front the online chats and some not very successfully either. I was constantly being promised a reply with 10 working days....5 working days....by the end of the week.....oh you will receive it by next Wednesday as our printer for the cheques has broken! Fobbed off big time and to think a big company like Virgin only have ""one"" printer to print the cheques....yeah right! The letter was a standard reply which lacked empathy or sincerity for any remorse regarding our stranded situation. They barely apologised. So why did it take 55 days to reply? Their website states 28 days which again they clearly failed like their trains. Would I recommend Virgin trains ""No""!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2018-05-26T11:35:19Z	Always late. Hopeless handling of compensation claims.	Utterly hopeless handling of the doubtless thousands of lateness compensation claims. They said that I was on a different train to which I was on (which was ironically also late, but not quite enough for compensation) and even though I proved to them that this was wrong they then ignored several chase emails for days. Next I'll drive, or go a longer route to avoid Virgin.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2018-05-26T11:35:19Z	No replies to repay delay	The problem I'm having seems to be quite a common one according to other reviews I have just read. The repay delay system is absolutely dreadful, I have only received the usual automated replies, no solution or refund with regards to a delayed service. I have now been waiting for approx. 8 weeks and that's just for a reply, not good at all.The automated replies are sent, nothing further.A shame really as cant fault the train service until there is a delay, which I know cannot sometimes be avoided, but a quicker response would be appropriate. This sadly lets the company down.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

I'm sure they do this on purpose to save costs as half the trains that day were cancelled for no good reason.Because our train was cancelled we were due a refund.  I contacted and followed the proper procedures.  I have contacted 5 times now and every time they say they will issue a refund asap.  But I'm still waiting over two months later, so annoying.I also have to do the same trip again between London and Manchester later in the year and it's £338 return when booking the maximum 12 weeks in advance. Absolutely crazy prices.  All this whilst the owner of the company sits on a Caribbean island not paying any tax!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

I applied a day or so after I got home on 12th March, sent photo of my tickets, filled in online form - I've heard absolutely nothing except automated replies when I chase, which I have, about 8 times -  Its not that its a huge sum of money it really isn't - its the principal, they promote this service because you have been inconvenienced, then don't pay up!!  It took me FOUR hours to get from Birmingham to Harpenden Herts, which should have taken no more than 2. I've just asked on Messenger for an address to complain to and she's given me Customer Resolutions which is the exact same dept who DONT reply!!

2018-04-17T06:42:22Z	This company is a joke	"Me and my boyfriend had to use Virgin to travel to Edinburgh. What got me first was the fact, that even tho Virgin has their own internet service, 3rd class only has 15(!!) minutes of free internet. I'm not originally from the UK and all the trains I've travelled with in Europe had always free internet. For how expensive Virgin's trains are, I'd at least expect that. Our train got delayed on our way from Edinburgh to Newcastle, due to ""cleaning"" the train, well they put those reservation tickets on the seats but train was still full of garbage from the previous passengers. Train arrived 20 minutes late and we missed our train from Newcastle to Sunderland. Was told we could get the next one, problem was the same line was due in the next hour and we didn't want to wait. Their customer service boot was closed for some reason so we tried asking the lady at the tickets place, if we could get a refund, she said, obviously annoyed, we'd have to do that at where we bought them. Needless to say, I'll try my best to not travel with this company again."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2018-04-17T06:42:22Z	ABSOLUTELY AWFUL EXPERIENCE WITH VIRGIN TRAINS!!!	I gave one star because I couldn’t give - 5!!!!Today 30 March 2018 got to Virgin train from London King’s Cross to Pitlocry ( Scotland ), just to find out that  if you don’t reserve a seat they don’t guarantee you one. So they accept more bookings than seats they can actually guarantee you, but they don’t tell you so when you book a ticket .So, you might find yourself travelling for 8 hours sitting on the floor or, even worse standing still, struggling to find a bit of space for yourself or balance as there are, understandably, other passengers continuously moving in these very narrow corridors trying to find a seat. In spite of these very bad travelling conditions my partner and I were still smiling trying to enjoy our long weekend away from London until, one of the Virgin staff, told us to move away from the 1st class area where we found some space to sit on the floor. My partner then, tried, to make a comment about that awful situation, and all this Virgin staff “gentleman” was able to say, in a VERY ARROGANT way, was “WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?!”, and that the only ones to blame about that situation were us, as if we booked a seat that wouldn’t have happened!WHAT A VERY BAD SERVICE AND EVEN WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE!Never ever Virgin trains again!!!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

We then made the journey by London Overground and had no need for the tickets we had been incorrectly charged for.      We would be grateful for a full refund of £26.50!      When attempting to make a complaint about this, I wasted ages in waiting for Virgin Trains' online chat service - which never happened, a complete sham it seems.

Virgin customer relations are simply terrible they show no compassion or are in any way reasonable. I had paid for a Virgin East Coast train and at a peak cost I was not trying to fare dodge or de-fraud the company but they show no interest in customer relations.

Me and my wife ended up paying £380 for a journey from Milton Keynes to Edinburgh on second class for the pure fact that the website was very confusing when tickets were bought. Virgin trains doesn't do ticket extensions, you have to buy the whole ticket again and you won't get a refund for the previous. I was never treated,as a customer in this manner. Anyway, one wish I have . Don't even bother Virgin Trains Representative to reply to my review with a "" i am very sorry , i will look into it and get it sorted"" , because i already spoke to 3 different people from your customer care dept and they been everything but helpful. So, overall, i would've been better hiring a cab for the same journey, and still be better off. Will never use virgin trains again ever."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

They could deliver so much but what they do deliver comes so short of the expectation.I recently did Glasgow - Birmingham and chose a First Class return, mainly because it promised a lounge at Birmingham and a meal on the train but, 'We don't offer the hot meal on this journey, snacks and sandwiches...' and the lounge at the station was closed at 1800 - the door was faulty!More recently a trip from Glasgow to Warrington was interrupted as 'Lines were down...' Okay - not Virgins fault and they were quick to offer the refund service. BUT, having applied for the refund I got a message to say they couldn't identify my booking. I replied with the confirmation email that they sent me when I booked and 3 weeks later, still no refund.So much more you could do to raise your game - c'mon	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	3

They were very attentive & forever offering us more food & drinks. Very chatty too which was great.However, came back on Monday 5th March on the 13.40 from Euston.Male stewards were working & boy what a difference.

However, what followed is unbelievable in the 21st century. We eventually managed to get a train back on Monday 5th March as they had been cancelled until then with no alternative offered other than a refund of our ticket.Trying to contact Virgin is impossible and have to rely on social media for regular updates. We have emailed several times but just get the automated response and here we are 7th March and still heard nothing. We are out of pocket by almost £300 for further hotel costs plus the cost of meals etc. We were obviously not the only ones as lucky to keep our room.

2018-03-07T11:57:03Z	Purchased a return ticket for a journey…	Purchased a return ticket for a journey and paid for the tickets to be delivered. The journey was split with a change at Derby so I should have received four individual tickets for each leg of the journey, only received three. After contacting was informed that the person making the journey would be required to go to a ticket machine to obtain the fourth ticket. This was not suitable as I purchased the ticket for my partner so firstly, she would not have my bank card (required at the machine) nor would she be able to use the machine hence my payment to have the tickets delivered. If I wanted to or was able to use the ticket machine I would have done so for all the tickets. Escalated the call to Virgin Trains and was told a supervisor would call back within 24 hours, no one called. Second time was informed someone would call back within 72 hours, no one called. My only alternative was to obtain the missing ticket from another train company so now I have paid twice for the same journey. Less than happy with this awful service from Virgin Trains.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2018-03-07T11:57:03Z	Awful, awful company	I have already posted a review about how awful Virgin East Coast are but I have now found out that Virgin West Coast are awful too. During the snow disruption I travelled from Preston to Carlisle with them. The train was announced and shown on the board as going to Glasgow, but as soon as the doors were closed they announced it would be terminating at Carlisle because of the snow situation further north. There were people who would not have got on that train if they had been told this originally. They were all simply dumped at Carlisle and told that they'd have to wait there until the line re-opened (which was being measured in days rather than hours), or go back towards London. There were no more hotel rooms available in Carlisle, which is quite a small town. I was travelling across the country to Newcastle so I was not directly affected, but I felt so desperately sorry for all these poor stranded people. I sat next to a quite elderly  lady who had joined the train to Carlisle because she had been told by Virgin staff it was going on to Glasgow and was now having to travel to Newcastle just to find a hotel room. There is no way that Virgin central command, wherever that is, did not already know that the line to Glasgow was blocked, but their customer service is so routinely appalling that they didn't feel it necessary to share accurate information with the public, let alone make any attempt to help people who were stranded. From now on I am only travelling with Transpennine. And there is no way I would ever buy any other product from the Virgin empire, because the sight of their logo just makes me feel sick.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

It cost more than the other carrier and so we expected a higher standard. We paid for a table and 4 seats with window view for our family for this long journey. Instead when we got on the train we had front facing seats, a blank wal that shielded our view,   no table  and NO STAFF TO ASSIST. We then observed people sitting anywhere they pleased despite the reserved seat signs. I am dusgusted! Needless to say I will not be travelling with Virgin again. Hopefully Richard Branson would get iff his island and tend to his business.POOR! POOR! POOR!I cant wait to get off this train. My 4 year old has to stare at a wall!!!!

Obtained a seat. However, it came to my attention via another passenger that the carriage I was in was not going onto my destination and I would have to reboard the carriages further up the train at Birmingham, this was not announced on boarding the train. I clarified with the train manager and he confirmed. I was with my daughter, luggage and on crutches because of a broken bone in my foot. I asked the TM to help at Birmingham, he answered he didn't think he could because he had his own bags. Fortunately a much younger colleague of his had the decency to offer to help. At Birmingham, I could not get a seat in first class or indeed any carriage and we had to stand from Birmingham to Wolverhampton, me on crutches and an air boot on. In addition, the announcement did not announce my destination stop and I had to rearrange my lift to one of the other stations announced. I eventually managed to sit down in a standard carriage. I complained to Virgin.... you have to wait for a call back.... good gate keeping. The ineptitude of the customer 'relations' staff is startling! My complaint wasn't addressed, it was almost a standard letter, I complained about it. Again I did not receive an adequate response! None of the points to my complaint were addressed!This is insulting! Protecting Richard Bransons Billions!! I can't speak I'm so annoyed! I would never travel Virgin anything if I could avoid it, nor recommend. Feeble excuses and inept staff!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2018-01-24T14:01:56Z	Rubbish	Myself, my husband and 11 year old son travelled from Manchester to London in December and I paid for first class tickets. The breakfast was awful and no snack box was offered on the way there. I am assuming that this was because part way through the journey they declassified first class. On the tannoy we were told to contact virgin who would compensate. I assumed this would be the difference between price for standard and first class. On our return journey, we tried to disembark the train at Manchester only to be pinned against the seats by Manchester Utd fans on their way home, who bombarded the train. They had no allocated seats which meant it was a free for all. My son was on crutches and couldn't move. The response from virgin 6 weeks later was a cheque for £15 compensation and an email to say if I wasn't happy with the conduct of the football fans,  to contact transport police and it's not their fault if people don't listen to instructions to let people leave the train before getting on.

2018-01-24T14:01:56Z	Just amazingly crap	Well I actually thought I was going to be in the minority giving this rating but it's refreshing to see that I'm not. 3 times in the space of 3 weeks virgin have cancelled, been late by 30 minutes and let people sit in our reserved seats during first class. Scenario 1: We decided to treat ourselves and travel first class for the first time. As virgin had cancelled the train before us they had told everyone that they can sit where they like. Even in reserved seats! So when we asked for people to move, understandably they were reluctant as their train was cancelled, but this meant we were left seatless in first class. After a few awkward discussions we managed to get a seat, but felt incredibly uncomfortable during the entire journey. The staff on board were friendly, though you could tell they were equally as frustrated as well. Safe to say this will be the last time I try first class again. The others were just late, each by 30 minutes which meant that I missed my connecting train. Both also annoying but less memorable as it has almost become predictable by Virgin Trains. Tl;dr - awful service - though I know it is difficult, avoid at all costs	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2018-01-24T14:01:56Z	Virgin trains you are just complete rubbish and your customer service is a joke	"Just before Christmas. My girlfriend and I booked a train to Scotland through the Virgin website.They accepted the payment.Got to the station, was told to get on the wrong train. arrived late for the link and was promptly told that it was ""our own fault for getting on the wrong train"" even though we were told to get on said train.Had to stand for at least three stops because our reserved seats were on a different train.Absolutely no help from anyone.So complained to Virgin.There response was incredible.Hi Sarah, I didn't turn your boyfriend away but I did advise that as this journey wasn't with us, the complaint wouldn't go through us. I understand you booked on the Virgin Trains website, but we show different routes that we don't run, with different companies. This is the same if you were to book with Cross Country, West Midlands Railway or any other company. On your confirmation is shows you would be travelling with Northern from Nottingham to Chesterfield and then with Cross Country from Chesterfield to Glasgow. This would also be shown when booking. If there was an issue with the booking/payment then this would go through us. But if there is an issue with your journey, the complaint would lye with the company you travel with as they are responsible. In this case I believe you wish to make a complaint about staff and being misinformed, therefore you would need to file a complaint with the company responsible for this. Unless you spoke with a Virgin Trains West Coast representative then you wouldn't complain through us I'm afraid. -They accepted payment, it is their responsibility to supply the service that has been paid for.If not then they are in breach of buyer-seller contractual obligation.Don't use Virgin, they will rip you off and laugh all the way to the bank whilst doing it."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2018-01-24T14:01:56Z	Nightmare train with drunk people	I don't even know where to start, we boarded the virgin train from Kings cross/London to newcastle on 23.12.17 at 8pm.We (including my 10 year old son) booked a second class ticket with reserved seats. Soon after finding our seats we realized we were seated right behind a group of hooligans, drinking and screaming. they had a stash of lager cans, passed around vodka bottles and used very foul language, while offering my son a can of beer. I have never in my life seen anything like this before, this was a train with children on it!So we had to walk all the way through the train, as staff (and POLICE) were all conveniently placed close to first class where they were not needed. While walking through the train, I noticed almost everyone was drinking, I had to endure rude and sexual comments by drunk men and was even grabbed at some point! We were advised that this is a non-dry train and drinking is allowed. we may however upgrade to first class for an additional 25 pounds/person. We were furious, but had no other choice but to upgrade, we were not going to sit with those drunks for 3 hrs on that train!To summarise, we experienced drunk behavior, sexual assault, scaring of a minor and in addition to that spent a further 75 Pounds on an upgrade to first class. I will certainly never travel again on any of these trains, I was shaken after this, we were all stressed and my son was incredibly scared.

When I look at my journey details I can’t see the times it should be at various points, as it has ON TIME written over the top of it, so you can’t see it. The front page of the App refuses to remember my personal settings, even though I’m logged in.

If you do book a seat you can guarantee their bookings system will fail and you will be forced into a Mexican standoff with someone and try finding a guard to help you're more likely to win the lottery than thatDon't take anymore luggage than a small carrier bag with a toothbrush in it no toothpaste as that wouldn't fit into luggage racks and don't use toilet as you can also guarantee you will have to play toilet roulette which is where you have a 1 in 32 chance that water will come out tap when you want to wash your handsCrushed into tiny seats designed for Tolkien-esque creatures with a hip to knee length of 10 cm, whilst drinking delicious instant coffee you wouldn't clean drains with, but at least they put cafe Nero on cup to make you feel better whilst they mix up your instant yum yum.If anyone ran a real business this badly they would be prosecuted for fraud selling non existent seats and non existent service at ever increasing prices for which you get less,The bribes must be working It's cheaper to fly via Berlin to London than travel by train what a bunch of absolute jokers the day I see Branson standing next to a smelly toilet for 6 hours that's the day I ll change my mind absolute bunch of charlatans	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

Called them and they told me I have to send my other tickets back - fair enough, but when were you going to tell me this exactly, if I hadn't called????So I sent the tickets back and STILL nothing!Called them and they said they are ready to process my refund (oh thanks so much.....)BUT I STILL HAVENT RECEIVED IT.

2017-12-22T11:03:56Z	Poor attitudes.	"Disgusting customer service. A couple of months ago the machine did not print my dad's ticket - the Virgin staff at Birmingham new street instead of coming to the machine and helping told him to simply buy a new one at a different machine - why should he buy the same ticket twice??? Today my mobile app ticket wouldn't download and again the new street virgin staff told me to buy a brand new ticket or call the customer services line to sort it out (""the sooner you stop moaning and call them the better"") - I was 16th in the queue and my train was in 10 minutes. Seems like a massive scam to make people buy the same ticket twice and of course it's more expensive on the day of travel when I had already bought these tickets in advance to be cost effective in the face of rapidly rising ticket prices. Disgustingly unhelpful, rude and patronising staff, so unexpected given that virgin are supposed to be known for their customer service."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

I expect more when I pay for First Class Tickets. I was travelling with a family member who's disabled so I was unable to leave my seat. I would have thought Virgin would look after their customers better, especially those with disabilities.

I became suspicious when we started to call at All stations from then on. As we came into Rugby, the conductor confirmed this and said I had just enough time to collect my bags and change trains. In the rush, I left my iPhone under the table, which was charging.I told the Virgin staff this at Rugby while boarding the London train and they intercepted the BR Train further down the line and managed to return my phone.It was delight in the First Class of VIRGIN Trains for the remainder of the trip to London and I cannot Commend the staff of VIRGIN Highly enough for their speed and efficiency for organising me back onto the next train to London, and the recovery of my iPhone. Overall I lost about an hour!A few weeks later I travelled on German Railways from Dresden to Berlin, also first class. GR could learn a lesson or two from VIRGIN about customer service. First Class was packed, their was no seat allocation with my wife and I at either end of the train and nowhere to put our bags. Their First Class lounge at Dresden had access only by a huge flight of steps, which wasn't  an option with two heavy bags.In a sea of one stars VIRGIN certainly kicked my goals for me-thankyou	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5

2017-11-22T19:07:48Z	By all means go on 1st class but NOT ON WEEKENDS!	We travelled from London Euston to Preston (Lancs) in first class on the weekend.  NEVER EVER buy a 1st class ticket on a weekend or Bankholiday this is because they will try to con you. First of all you pay around £90-£150 for a oneway fare 1st class and all you get is a muffin, cup of tea and a banana. Not 1st class standard at all. The lounge itself has a very poor selection of food but has a coffee machine and a few flapjacks. No Cerial or toast or pastrys of any kind. So if your on the first train of the day like I was you dont expect a full breakfast buffet. EAT before you leave.Staff are good. Virgins onboard WIFI however is DREADFULL. Overall would I travel in 1st class again with Virgin west coast? Yes i would but only on a weekday not weekend becasue its just not worth it.

2017-11-22T19:07:48Z	Appalling service.	Appalling service.They are at the front of a shameful operating methodology that is vindictive at its core.I made a booking online and attempted to cancel it, going through steps tied to my ticket I was under the impression that this would happen. Yet later I find that my ticket was ineligible for a refund. This is a nonsense, firstly a system with a back-end database such as this should flag this ineligibility when you first click to refund the ticket and most importantly how can it be rationalised that for my paying money over (an exorbitant fee) and a few automated processes happening they can withhold a refund... I received no service and yet they take all my money.Virgin trains are a disgrace and represent all that is wrong with this country.I fully intend to boycott Virgin services for life.Edit - 2 years on and I still am boycotting them. I've also convinced many people I know to move off their Internet phone and TV services.

Although, asked for a delay repayment for a 50  minute delay 3 weeks ago, the form has disappeared. Was over an hour late yesterday with no seat: I think they cancelled my train to save cost after we waited on the platform at Doncaster for an hour or so yesterday evening(5/11/17). The don't pick up the phone (15 mins and counting(18.55 6/11/17). The loo's are variable. Today(12/11/17) stuck in doncaster 45 mins.

2017-11-22T19:07:48Z	Do not bother with 1st class rip off!!	One star is one too many in my opinion! One day between trains and a completely different experience in the second. The first journey provided great service tables set out, hot food choices, wine available as well as soft drinks and the staff couldn’t do enough for us. When we boarded for the second leg we were abruptly by one of the onboard staff members who firstly advised we were in the wrong place (I wasn’t as I booked and paid a fortune for anytime) and then rudely advised me that as I had boarded an earlier train than originally planned I wouldn’t have my pre reserved seats. I understood this but I paid a lot of money for anytime as I knew my plans were likely to change and did not expect such a rude response.  The next thing is the choice of a wrap (very nice if you like spicy food) my mum doesn’t or alternatively what equates to a cheese spread sandwich. We asked for a glass of wine with our food and were told that wine is not served on a weekend but we could purchase it from the bar!! Really?? We had it on a Friday and we could buy it from the baron we wanted alcohol so why not serve it within the extortionate price of a first class ticket???? This is ridiculous and certainly not consistent with the choices delivered on our journey the previous day. In the end after paying £762.00 I went to the bar and paid extra for refreshments and hot food for this sector of our journey which takes almost 4 hours of our total trip. Very disappointing after the excellent service and choice offered previously......absolutely disappointed and surprised at the lack of customer care.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

Weekend trains take a hour longer with no explanation why. Can't reserve a seat modification if you make it that far on the booking process. Trains are always under-stocked and delayed. Tickets are hideously overpriced for the service provided and if your train is delayed and you make a claim, chances are they will try and worm their way out of paying you the refund you're entitled to.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

This evening I met Micheal a virgin ticket inspector . Well done Micheal you have just wreaked virgins customer service record with me .I made the easy mistake to run for a train and as you do grab the nearest door to not miss the train . I made another mistake to take a phone call and stand in an unoccupied  corridor right by the now closed door . Intending to walk down the train and find a normal carriage . But as my farther was going through major heart surgery that day I wanted to take the call .Well that’s when the fun began . Micheal a name I discovered later . Came along and saw me on the phone . Wouldn’t let me wind the call up even though I asked for a few seconds continued to raise his voice so even the other person on the other end was shocked . Demanded  in an aggressive manner to see my ticket I closed the call and got the app up and was searching for my online ticket . He almost tried to take the phone from me and search himself . I said hang on please I have loads of tickets on here . He said it’s use the app it helps in a sarcastic manner . I said I am using the app be patient . I looked up and saw a first class sign ok got it now , I apologised and said I wi go to the next caroage  explained why I boarded tiding that door he just said move to the next carriage . No please just move . I said you are very rude he said you should of used another door . Boy I thought where is. Ustomer service here and ok yes mistake made admitted and this guy is on a mission  here . I said what is your name please he said Micheal what’s yours I said I don’t need to tell you that and said again you don’t need to be rude . He practically pushed me through the carriage raising his voice in front of all the other passengers and saying you don’t belong in first class and next time use the other door to board the train . He even followed me out into the standard carriage and continued to say the same thing . He eventually walked on and after counting to 10 continued my call.Ok mistake made but rush for a train we all have . The treatment and attitude this Micheal offered was a disgrace and rather than pick fights with customers berate then and harass them he could of said no problem I understand sir and let me move on but no cheap and nasty behaviour that makes me think why virgin .  I am sure mr Branson doesn’t like to hear such attitude . Anyway that said it could be an off day for Micheal on the Euston train from Manchester but even so get a grip . Get off the power trip and learn the basics .	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

My argument is if Virgin can't offer a full first  class service then we should be able to switch  to a second class ticket  and refund the difference. Is this not a fair option.

2017-10-15T17:27:59Z	Appalling Customer Service	Virgin Trains customer service rates as the worst I've ever experienced in my entire life. I've never before been driven to post such a review, but they've pushed me over the edge! The last three occasions that I've travelled on Virgin - both East Coast and West Coast - have resulted in delays of 45 minutes, two hours, and 40 minutes.I've filed delay repay claims for all three of these 'experiences'. The response to the first claim - a cancelled train from Leeds to King's Cross - was met with a denial that the train was even cancelled! This, in spite of the fact that the train clearly was cancelled - ie, all station information boards showing it as cancelled; a large crowd of annoyed passengers having to wait 30 minutes for the next depature; the next departure being inevitably overcrowded, and then having to stop at those additional stations which the cancelled train would have stopped at.I then tried calling Virgin Customer Services. I was wrongly directed to three different phone numbers, and eventually gave up after having waited for an hour, having to endure the god-awful muzak, plus the voice informing me that someone will be with me as soon as possible.One week after this cancelled journey from Leeds, I suffered a two hour delay from Birmingham to Euston. That was almost three weeks ago, and I've still received no reply regarding my delay repay.Like I said before.... appalling customer service. One star is over-generous.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2017-10-15T17:27:59Z	Wifi mostly didn’t work for 3 hour journey. Excessive air con for Sept	Cons: 1. Terrible, outdated and often non- functioning “free” wifi for anything other than very basic tasks. The cynic in me will state that you can pay for a better (money generating) wifi. Very frustrating for a 1st World country in the year 2017. 2. Face gets constantly blasted with excessive air con for late Sept. Am sure I got a head cold from this after 3 hours. Can neutral temperature air not be circulated in cooler months please? Again this was very annoying/ uncomfortable. I try to be objective so here are the pros:Pros:1. Carriages/ seats well maintained.2. Ticket staff were friendly.3. On time (expected but still a plus).	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2017-10-15T17:27:59Z	Don't use, and if you have to, reserve a seat	I used Virgin trains for the first time this weekend. I didn't reserve a seat because on the train companies I usually use, this is either not possible or not necessary. Not so with Virgin: both trains I took were fully booked, which means that out of 8 or 10 carriages, there is a single one with non-reserved seats. This is obviously not enough for all the people who turn up without a reservation - either because they weren't aware that it is necessary or because they couldn't know in advance which train they would be able to take, or because they missed the one they had reserved seats on. (Virgin charges you for changing a reservation, apprently.) In consequence, I had to sit on the floor outside the toilet for 2 hours, with many fellow-sufferers. The worst thing about this was the smell from the toilet - the chemical disinfectant is so strong that it makes you feel sick when passing the toilet on the outside, let alone sit there for any length of time...	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2

Birmingham to Glasgow.. They don't care about compensating . All they say is ""sorry"" a million times in the announcement which makes your ears go deaf. On top of poor service they annoy you with horrible announcements. Sorry is not going to convince people. I would have preferred to see some action to have taken place to compensate the passengers. The data connection drops very often (the enhanced data connectivity message is a joke). Their adverts on how they are better over car journeys make me cringe.. its pathetic..Generally, UK train companies are terrible but atleast not all of them charge so much money for terrible service.. there is more style from outside looking at Virgin trains but there is no substance !!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2017-10-15T17:27:59Z	Careful of Aaron in 1st class	Don't be surprised if you get very poor service and cocky attitude by Aaron who works in first class possibly on the London Euston to Glasgow service. Management generally will also brush it off. Be particularly wary if you are of a brown or yellow make and model. My advice would be to deal with it on the spot yourself, as virgin are not bothered by the bad reviews and generally have a monopoly on some routes.

2017-10-15T17:27:59Z	Do not use virgin trains!	I booked a virgin train ticket online but had to use the London Midland website because the virgin website kept crashing at the payment screen. When I got to Euston to collect my ticket from the machines there was a software problem so I could not retrieve my tickets so I showed a virgin customer service assistant my receipt and explained my circumstances but he refused to let me travel insisting I had to buy another ticket at a cost of £33. He was extremely rude and condescending and I had to go home and come back the next day and pay to travel again at gross inconvenience. I contacted virgin and they took a month to reply only to offer me a half price ticket for my next journey taking no account of the aggravation and cost I had endured previously.Having heard the story of the army veteran with prosthetic legs who was refused travel, Branson the tax dodger needs to be brought to book and his franchise revoked.

2017-10-15T17:27:59Z	Please please DO NOT give your hard earned money to virgin!!!	Please please DO NOT give your hard earned money to virgin!!!! Booked a well deserved trip to Brighton with my daughter-1st class as a treat after both my parents dying within 11weeks of each other. No 1st class exists on a weekend- apart from extra leg room seats!!!! No where does it say this or make you aware when you are booking! Only found out after reading reviews. Virgin website says its limited at weekends & bank holidays, LIMITED!!!- what a joke, coffee or tea & a horrible bun & an Apple or banana!!! & bottle of water!!!.  On returning home from Brighton, we needed to use the London underground, the lines we needed were delayed & it was advising people to use different routes, I was on my own with my daughter & not familiar with underground etc. We ended up missing our train at Euston.  I went to 4 different virgin desks at Euston, kept getting passed around to be told I would have to buy new tickets. If I wanted to travel straight  Manchester now it would cost me £200! If I went a very long way round which would take 4hours (normally 2), it would cost £60, I was getting very scared & upset as on my own with young daughter, I was very distraught &  was crying very much, I asked why I had to pay again when it wasn't my fault about the underground, to which the reply was its not our fault either! The male who was serving me was very rude & arrogant & mad  me feel very degraded! I sed I didn't have extra money, he sed get someone else to pay!!!! I asked -who- This  man next to me in the queue- he said yes ask him, he was smirking all the time he was talking! He then sed I will check price for last train tonight-midnight or one for tomorrow!!! I said I don't want to do that, I'm with my young daughter- he said not my problem, I had to tell him to get someone else to serve me  as he was so  humiliating!! Even the guy getting served next to me said he wants reporting- his attitude is appalling,. I have never felt so mistreated & made to feel so low , stood their in tears. I had to end up paying £60 to get home ( which was 9pm) should have been  4.40pm. Oh & his name was BILAL!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

Aug 2017:Even if you have your tickect reciept,  aswell as your seat reservation ticket, but not the 'ticket' you will not be allowed on the train.. and need to pay for a whole new journey.. even though you have already paid 187.00..but no they want another 82 pound! this is ludacris! Virgin trains do NOT use common sense! Would score zero if it was possible. Virgin, please ask yourself why 5 coupons tickets plus a coupon reciept are necesary for one return trip... not everyones phones can use phone tickets. To makes things worse the Virgin personnel at the desk took so long to decide my options that my train had left, meaning I get home almost 2hours late, and he clearly has NO customer service skills or is able to smile... a smile is free! ok rant over, but overall Virgin I think common sense has really been lost with your service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

I simple then went through the booking process to order the ticket and there was absolutely no reference to the 50% off??? I checked the T&C and I was eligible... but no 50% off. And NO indication of why. I simply wanted to buy my ticket... but the SALE SIGN ...then no 50% off price PROMPTED me to call up Virgin Trains... and their service was then rubbish!! I made 5 separate calls!! And no one new anything!!! One my calls was for 20 mins!! and NO answer! Over an hour of frustrating calls, re-directions and no answers. WHY SAY THERE IS A 50% OFF SALE WHEN THERE ISN'T ONE! I probably have now added another 50% on to the price of my ticket (through phone call fees), which I'll have to now pay at full price!!!!!!!! NOT VERY HAPPY!!A rubbish service which cause me to be very frustrated...I was going to formally complain on their web page but to do that would have taken ages to fill in, and I reckon they probably won't even see it!So venting here!!!!!GRRRRRR :(	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

After 45 mins on hold to east coast trains, was told sorry they could not help me as I was travelling on a west coast train service!So who can help me???The young lady Gemma did her best to help out and reserved some seats for my daughter and promised me an email to confirm, this email has never materialised. I collected my tickets from the station and noted the seat numbers had not been changed on my daughters tickets.Don't bother asking at the ticket office! Again they could do with some lessons in the art of listening to the customer to understand the query before fobbing them off and then trying to liken your situation to a personal one they are having with an airline company!!!!so still no resolution!I called customer service again only to be asked by an operator 3 times what type of ticket I held, I explained three times , the family advance ticket for £99 for two adults and two children and an advance for my daughter with her 16.25 railcard. "" so you want me to book seats for you for 4 adults?"" Frustrated and completely fed up, I asked to speak to a manager, eventually I did get to speak to a manager only to be told west coast trains cannot help me, I have to speak to east coast trains as I've booked their service!!!Give me strength!!! Back to square one!How does a customer with an issue get some customer service?Even when you email a complaint, the only thing you get back is a generic email!

2017-09-05T16:39:05Z	Abysmal customer service	"I will do my best to avoid ever using Virgin Trains again!  I bought first class return tickets on the East Coast main line in April for a special break for my wife and me.  The journey to London was very pleasant actually, but on the way back to Scotland we were delayed by over 2 hours, missed the connecting train and were crammed into standing room only carriages.  It was a dreadful journey.The main issue I have is not with the delayed train (which was caused by a track fault), but with Virgin's handling of the refund claim (which is governed by rail regulator standards I think.)  After three months, many phone calls and emails, most of which go unanswered, I only know that Virgin have agreed to refund me but have no idea if they ever will.  Whereas you can get through to their ticket sales staff by phone immediately, they can't deal with complaints or refunds.  The customer service phone line always - and I mean always - has a ""we're experiencing a high volume of calls"" message and can involve an hour or two of waiting to get anyone to answer.  Often you just eventually get cut off.So, in summary, a decent service if it works - if it doesn't, customer service is frankly abysmal."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

I contacted Virgin Trains to change the seats only to be told that train is fully booked and no other seats available.I went online and to my amusement, I could actually book tickets in the first class for the same date and time in a different coach. There were at least 20 seats available.I ran Virgin Trains customer service and asked again to change my seats, pointing out that there are seats in a different coach. I was placed on hold for 5 minutes and was told again, that ""miraculously"" all those seats were booked. Customer service representative suggested that I try to beg other passengers to swap with me! So be ware! The fact that you choose all your seats online does not mean that you'll get what you choose.

My son and I were travelling on that train and we were both extremely impressed by how efficient and professional Ms Smart was in dealing with a situation caused through absolutely no fault of Virgin trains. The train was absolutely packed because the previous train to Leeds had been cancelled so many people were in danger of missing their last connecting train en route to Leeds. Ms Smart was in constant contact with all the passengers on her train,reassuring everyone that she would do everything in her power to get everyone home - which is exactly what she did! She got every single one of the passengers to exactly where they had to be! She was absolutely amazing ..so calm and proficient as she repeatedly walked up and down the train aisle dealing with connecting passengers on a one-to-one basis.I've been on delayed trains before,I remember the stress and comments from angry passengers, but on this particular train,no-one, as far as I could hear/see was complaining ..quite the contrary actually! Ms Smart somehow transmitted an unusual sense of serenity and was absolutely meticulous in her directions ..for example ""passengers leaving the train at station X should disembark at exit door X ..your connecting train is waiting for you on platform X We're arriving on platform X so all you have to do is X"" So hats off to Ms Kirsty Smart for her highly professional customer-care skills and hats off to Virgin trains for employing someone who can keep your flag flying even in adverse circumstances!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5

Mix up with bags as my mum left earlier than we had do catch our train and forgot my purse with the tickets were still in her bag! After being messed around at London Euston station, after having both my mum and my brother speak to several members of staff they were basically willing to leave two 15 year olds at London station -on our own- until they could get to a station and fax the tickets over! Which may of been a while as they were on the motorway home already. Our train was due to set off in 5 minutes, we were so worried we weren't going to make it home we went down to the train and I spoke to a man who works for virgin trains, he was so lovely and understanding and he re assured me and my mum, who were both frantically panicking, that he would ensure we got on and got home safe and he would speak to the people on the train for us and just for her to meet us when we got off to show the tickets then😌 So happy this man was so kind and understanding after the half an hour of panic and arguing to try and get us home and not left there on our own. Lovely lovely staff. Couldn't be more thankful! Thanks to him we got home safe and on time and we knew we didn't have to worry anymore!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5

It is a train journey, something that human being have been doing for around 200 years. We know to turn up at the station at the right time and get on the train we want. But no. According to Virgin, we need guidance on how to get to the station, platforms plans, information about the 'experience' and about our destination.

The amount of times I have to ask (politely and point out the disabled Bay Area to non disabled drivers is annoying). The last straw was trying to park I get screamed ovaebities at me for parking. (See some people expect you to be 90 frail and see some wheel chair or sticks. Well I'm non of those ).  I have limited life expectancy and chronic pains. But try and do what I can and keep going... but the amount of abuse I get when trying to park here despite having a blue badge from stressed drivers who double park thinking I'm pushing in and they park and block yellow no parking areas and the main car park is bad.....

A freight train broke down in front of us which added a huge delay to the journey. Virgin staff were extremely helpful and ensured we stretched our legs on the platform we were thankfully sat at during the issues, brought us complimentary snacks and also kept us updated with as much info as they could provide. Upon arrival in Euston I was very worried as all tubes had finished for the evening as it was almost 3am but once I left the train staff were on hand to guide all customers to free taxis. Although the delay was a massive hassle, which was clearly out of Virgins control, the staff made up for this as much as possible.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2017-07-24T11:39:58Z	The most APPALING customer service experience! Will never use Virgin Trains again!	Wow where do I begin, I've recently experienced probably one of the worst customer service experiences ever.I purchased some tickets front London-Kings Cross (east coast service) however the next day I phoned up the East Coast customer relations team in order to amend the journey times. I was told the amendment service isn't working and after a lengthy discussion I was told I could receive a refund, I agreed to this option however at the time it was not convenient as it meant I would have to re-book all the tickets and as we all know, virgin train ticket prices increase by the day. Anyway, took the option then decided that same day I'll go for a coach option instead as it's much cheaper so went and booked some cheap coach tickets.That same day, I phoned back as I hadn't received any confirmation of the refund. I spoke to the same girl from Customer Relations who was extremely rude this time and said she had never agreed to a refund, although all their calls are recorded, when I said this she responded with 'I can't remember what I said but the computer screen in front of me says Refund Rebook so I just have said that'. (Refund Rebook is NOT a refund, it means I have to rebook another ticket to veto my old ticket). I was extremely annoyed by this and asked to speak to her manager, she said her manager would ring back in half hour. Needless to say, I never received this call back :).I phoned again 2 hours later, spoke to someone else in the team. Ranted about this, he was extremely apologetic and assured me he would action my refund right away and just to keep an eye on my bank statement over the coming days.A few days later I received an email from virgintrains east coast telling me the refund has been rejected and I need to contact TRAINLINE?! I was extremely confused because I had booked a VIRGIN train so why on Earth am I being told to contact trainline? I spoke to Virgin again, another extremely rude and patronising and unhelpful lady telling me my ticket is a west coast ticket although it is an east coast route, since I've booked on the virgin trains app it is a west coast route? She also said I need to speak to Trainline.I'm now very confused but nevertheless I phone Trainline in the hope a miracle may have occurred whereby they have access to virgin trains system and can help me but low and behold, they cannot, because it is a VIRGIN TRAIN ticket and has nothing to do with them! They have now told me to speak to Westcoast, which is a different department within Virgin.Westcoast have no record of my call to the Eastcoast customer relationships team because they do not have access to their system. So this person from West Coast has asked me to re-contact East Coast as they are the ones who have promised me a refund.So I do that, by email this time, receive a phone call the following day by a remarkably rude man called Ian from the web support team who tells me this is all MY FAULT because I contact east coast when I should have called Westcoast?? Excuse me? This is ONE COMPANY! And when you ring Virgin trains it clearly says my journey from London-Kings Cross is an EAST COAST JOURNEY. Furthermore, why on Earth are your staff willy nilly offering out refunds that they can not deliver on? His response was poor and didn't answer any of my questions at all and said he is deleting my request because East coast cannot help me although they have promised me a refund. He says call West Coast.So, for the 2nd time, I speak to west coast who echo their early comment about how they will not give me a refund because they didn't offer me one. East coast offered it, so I need to speak to them!This time I phoned the feedback team as I had had enough! Told them the situation, they said this is an EAST COAST journey so EAST COAST have to deal with it! Put me back through to Ian again (lucky me!) this time he was even ruder, he threatened to hang up on me and block my number! He even asked me where I work and said he's noted his down! He ended the call with the fact that he is taking no responsibility for the undelivered promise and that he will not be giving me a refund.I am now left in an awful position, I am £200 down (that's how much the train tickets costed) and not a single person is willing to help me although I was promised a refund 2 weeks ago! Albeit, by 'apparently' the wrong team - but that is NOT my problem! As a customer I am going to ring the people who I think can assist me and if they can't they should not make such promises!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-07-24T11:39:58Z	Brutal monopoly	If they didn't have a monopoly on the east/west coast lines I'd avoid virgin trains completely. The customer service at Euston station have clearly been trained to not give any flexibility, I've watched them stand by whilst a passenger cried in front of them, weekend plans ruined. My personal prejudice comes as a result of virgin not letting me into a train because I'd lost my railcard, despite my having brought printed proof of its existence, and having phoned the railcard company and virgin earlier in the day. The fault was mine, but after 8 years of travelling with a railcard it's only virgin that have screwed me over like this. I then contacted their customer service with proof of my railcard as well as proof of over 8 journeys taken with them over 12 months from euston to Liverpool, £56 a time, but they still refused to refund me even the railcard difference of the new tickets I was forced to buy. So much for supporting loyal customers! With first great western/great western railway the same thing happened, and they just made me provide proof of owning a railcard. Even when you do get on a train, the chances of getting a seat are rather low, though obviously you can work round this by booking ahead. It would be nice if they did what other companies sometimes do and open up first class rather than have people standing or sitting on the floor for 2 hours.On the west coast line they don't pay enough people to staff kings cross, even at rush hour, so that when the tickets printed off by their new ticket machines don't work, you have to join a long queue for the single staff member working on the manual gate. If only there was an alternative! Rant over.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2017-07-24T11:39:58Z	Virgin trains - bad choice	Virgin trains - 3 train cancellations in 1 week, only traveled 4 times in total - what a disaster of train services. The usual template response from them - take a next train..... which might be in 1 hour, but who cares? They don't! As if people do not have schedules and appointments to keep... pathetic excuses, what a circus. Used to be good, key word is 'used', avoid them like plague if you don't want to be stuck in a middle of nowhere with your train suddenly going back....terminated.... and no alternatives offered. After running around the station grabbing everyone in a uniform asking what to do you might get lucky with alternative service offer.... definitely avoid their overpriced and never-on-time-lucky-to-arrive-at-all-services. All 3 cancelled journeys were between Manchester and London, July 2017.My niece had to use trains for 2 weeks with summer school commuting between Stoke-on-Trent and Manchester, and after a few highly delayed Virgin journeys, we switched her to CrossCountry and Northern.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

Sunday 09/07/2017 On the 12:05.No hot food and no alcohol, which we accepted and continued. Apparently we should have had options of picnic tray, Tea, Coffee and water. The most miserable hard done to lady came along with a tray. She looked like a child who had had every sweet taken off her. After pleasantly asking for a cup of tea. The response was "" I'M NOT DOING TEA, I'M TOO BUSY"". We were then told that the options are Water and a cold sandwich. We said that we would have them. With a face like hell  she dropped the sandwiches and water on the table along with a tissue each. Not the best  £40 spent for sure.

2017-07-24T11:39:58Z	Filthy loos	Three of us traveled from Edinburgh to London on 30 June by the 1st class coach leaving 11:30 am. The train started two hours late due to some signal fault. The seats were really cramped behind the centre table. The worst were the washrooms which were triangular, very small and extremely dirty. It was a real challenge getting in and out, the place stank and the WC looked as if it had never been cleaned. I travel in trains in the US which is always a pleasurable and relaxing experience and I was expecting something like that but have vowed never to repeat this in the UK.

2017-07-24T11:39:58Z	Here's a complaint letter I wrote to …	Here's a complaint letter I wrote to Virgin today:I really don't know where to start.I bought a return ticket Euston-Manchester for £153. Here are the various complaints:1. The ticket machine from which I collected at New Malden station gave me 3 coupons: 1. the collection receipt 2., the Advance single for Euston-Manchester which included the seat reservation on it 3. the seat reservation for the Manchester-Euston trip. 2. The ticket barrier wouldn't let me through on the return from Manchester. The ticket barrier agent said I was missing another ticket to go with the seat reservation. I said it wasn't my problem as the machine hadn't printed it. He replied 'it's not my problem, go speak to the ticket desk'. That was a pretty unsympathetic reply.3. The ticket desk agent, Patricia, and her boss whose name I forget, were also unsympathetic, and implied I had forgotten to pick up the ticket from the machine. There wasn't a hint of an apology, instead they insisted I pay a further £82.90 to get a new ticket. They also batted away the problem saying I had to pick the issue up with South West trains as the machine was at their station.4. Your onboard snack shop attendant on the 17:35 from Manchester wouldn't let me carry my cup of coffee away in my hand and insisted he put it in a brown bag 'for health and safety reasons'. Is this a joke? Have you any idea what a ridiculous amount of waste you're creating? None of your European counterparts insist on a bag. Have some respect for the environment.5. Your Twitter team are clueless. They had no helpful response on the ticket issue, and when I told him about the bag issue his response was an unhelpful 'sorry to hear. I've never heard of that. PA'. A helpful reply would have been 'I'll look in to this for you, thanks for your feedback and I'll pass this on to management'. I would like a refund of the £82.90. The ticket was already expensive enough as it was (astronomical compared to the ticket prices for the much faster and quieter bullet trains I've travelled on throughout Italy, Spain, France, Germany, China, Russia, Japan).Also, train all of your staff to show a bit more respect and be less indifferent.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2017-07-24T11:39:58Z	NEVER put your traveller names on a ticket with Virgin	Having booked travel for 4 people for a business trip & opt to print tickets with the traveller's individual names on it, I had a change of circumstance that required one name to be changed a week before we were due to travel.  I called Virgin Trains on 0344 556 5650 only to be greeted with constant patronising and obtuse conduct that I would expect Virgin Trains to be way beyond in their quality of service.  As I was getting nowhere, I demanded to speak to a supervisor who was about 90% as difficult as the last rep.  As an exception, they agreed to refund the one ticket I needed to change and processed the purchase of a new, more expensive ticket for the same journey, just with a new name on the ticket.  For this pleasure, there was a £20 admin fee (which I managed to get waived) and a £20 hike in ticket price.The Virgin reps were completely deaf to my comments relating to poor customer service and instead, took the stance that they were right and I had failed to understand the processes of their system.  Should you ever book multiple tickets for a group, NEVER opt to put the names on each ticket.  The other option, where all tickets are collective, would let you swap travellers without any fuss or fees (as they would never know).  All this took over an hour on the phone as a manager callback service has a 48 hour turnaround, which I found unacceptable.simply poor customer service from Virgin.

2017-07-24T11:39:58Z	No Booking Requests Granted and Seats Reserved When They Are Free!	I booked a seat, for the June 21st, 10.30am Euston to Glasgow train, with my reservation for Warrington, being the first stop, almost two hours later, at 12.15. I was pleased to be able to choose 'Facing' and 'Quiet', as I suffer badly from motion sickness, when traveling backwards. Hence using Virgin's own site, not National Rail or Greater Anglia site. I was travelling from Norwich, and had requested the same, 'facing' seat for that part of the journey, too. However, Virgin made no attempt to satisfy my requests, as for both stages of my long journey Virgin allocated me the exact opposite of what I asked for! Backwards seating! I was able to change on the first leg of my journey, but on the second part, on the very crowded Euston to Glasgow train, I found that every seat on the Virgin train, had a silly, tiny LCD display, stating, ''Reserved''. I had to give up my own seat, as for me to sit with my back to the direction of travel would have meant sickness and vomiting within minutes! This would have caused me upset, appalled the other 50 or so in the carriage, and forced everyone to vacate, with no other vailable seats, so a disrupted service, possibly, due to lack of any form of customer care or service for someone who NEEDED to face direction of travel!YET, try as I might I could not see a Virgin representative anywhere and since it appeared every seat on the many carriages was reserved, I had to join the fight for a seat, with hundreds of other passengers trying to find a seat that was not occupied. Yet even when the seats were not physically occupied,  the suggestion was that they would be, for the entire journey, as each and every seat that I could see (and other irate passengers, too) simply had 'Reserved' on! The idiocy of Virgin is that the seats are NOT actually reserved for ALL of the journey, but they do not state the name, the time, and from where to where!!! Hence, one thinks they are reserved from start to end! I was going one stop, and there were several after me, so why can't this carrier tell people, in the LCD display? Or do what better companies do, and have card-tickets placed in the headrest of each seat, with a name, and time, and station to station statement. That way, if the seats are empty, and the details suggest they should be occupied, one knows the people booking have sat elsewhere. And just to stop the mayhem of passengers fighting to sit! Its madness!I found a seat, and had to take a chance, but the Virgin member of staff was obviously only collecting and selling tickets and not helpful, not able to help. It is Virgin, not the staff and they are at fault.I complained to their customer service, and a week later (yes a whole week!) got a patronising reply, informing me that my initial booking was merely a request, not a guarantee. Then WHY put me facing backwards on both trains? It would have been easy to face me! Then they did NOT address the reservation nonsense on all the seats of the express at all. I sent a second email, asking them to tell me why Virgin operate a fully reserved policy, when the seats were free? They did not answer me and despite my saying I would refer them to the Ombudsman, I still have not heard, some two weeks later.Virgin trains is operating a confusing policy, both in booking and in being on their trains, where one cannot see which seats are free at any given time. Surely, with people standing, when they could be sitting, this is open to accidents and simply over crowding already tight compartments, as Virgin really fill seats and seem to have narrow aisles, too.This lack of customer service, even when one complains, is appalling! And the manner of the reply was condescending, unhelpful, unapologetic, and it did NOT address my concerns, complaints or the serious second part of the complaint at all!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-07-03T11:11:14Z	Terrible customer service with regards to delayed trains - choose another rail company	Back in my student days in London, I used to frequently catch the Virgin trains to visit family up north. Though often over-sold and monstrously packed, it was otherwise a decent service and certainly one I was familiar with. However, it is always and only when things go wrong that you actually see the true colours and face of a company (and person for that matter). I was on a train which was delayed by 3 and a half hours, whereby we were stuck in the middle of the tracks for all this time so couldn't even descend. With a good book or friendly passengers it could have been fine, after all, these things happen. The problem was that I had a flight to catch from Birmingham International airport which I of course missed. On consulting the Virgin staff about this once we had finally arrived at Birmingham International, they of course dismissed my frustrations immediately, carelessly tossing me from one staff member to another, wasting further time. Eventually, I was told that I had to fix the situation myself and that it was absolutely nothing to do with them. There was no human sympathy (human empathy seems to have been actively erased from the concept of customer service in these behemoth-sized companies), and not even an apology or acknowledgement of the inconvenience caused. I was quite outraged by this, simply because Virgin brand itself and indeed pride itself on being a premium rail company with excellent customer experiences. The premium ticket prices they charge also reflect the fact that believe they are adequately rewarding the customer for this, which should include genuine, authentic, human customer service.Obviously when everything goes fine, there's never a problem. But I believe it's important to be conscious of which companies actually, genuinely do care about their customers, as many, many businesses out there simply put up the facade and in reality when s*** hits the fan, they simply don't. I was disappointed to realise Virgin was one of them. I've been taking London Midland and other rail lines much more frequently, and despite much slower journeys (bring a good book or your smart-whatever to watch/ listen to something), I find the minimum one-third slashed prices are definitely worth it.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

Really. ?Last week I was offered Polenta cake.  It was so greasy, just looking at it made me feelill.   Stick with normal banana or fruit cake.The Harissa salad and salmon offered up to quite recently, lovely, why change ?Wraps, no thank you.Even the sandwich on offer today have weird ingredients.  Stop trying to be clever Chefs, and offer real tasty British food.  By the choices on offer it would suggest that you are aiming at Continental tastes. We are British, regular customers, so please stick with plain British food, and something in a sandwich that we can at least recognise.Love travelling Virgin First Class, but for the price I am paying would like something on offer that I can actually eat,Thank goodness the wine is normal.

2017-07-03T11:11:14Z	Virgin guard mis-activated e-ticket and cost me £172	"I used the Trainline mobile app and booked a return from Liverpool Lime St to Euston going out Monday, back Tuesday - for my colleague and I. Outbound, I showed my activated ticket to the Virgin guard at the Virgin-dedicated barrier on the Virgin-dedicated platform. I expected him to scan the barcode and let us through but there was no scanner in sight. Instead, he looked at our activated outbound tickets but then he insisted on scrolling to the return ticket screen, saying we had to activate that too.  I protested, as the return trip wasn't until the next day and, if activated, would have rendered that ticket invalid on the day I actually wanted to use it. But the Virgin guy wouldn't let me through until the return ticket had also been activated! It was crazy. A queue of people waiting to get through behind us and I'm telling him and telling him that the return ticket screen should NOT be activated, at which point he actually leaned in to my phone and pressed the 'activate' key himself, saying ""no, you need to press THIS one, there you go, you can go through now...""! I was actually speechless which, for me, is highly unusual. On the journey down, my colleague and I kept saying to one another that we were pretty sure our return tickets were now useless for the next day but we had no time to take this up with Virgin at Euston because we had to go straight to our meeting.Of course, the next day when we got to Euston for the return trip, the ticket was invalid because it had been activated the day before and was considered 'used'. We had to pay another £172 to get home and I'm still fuming. Although this is entirely the fault of the Virgin staff member at Lime Street, I don't understand why the Trainline app doesn't work off the barcode. That is, UNTIL that barcode has been scanned, the ticket is valid. That's the point of it, surely? The Virgin guard would not have been able to do this on the wrong ticket, because the barcode would be day-specific. As it was, as soon as that 'activate' button gets manually pressed on the screen, that's it, and how many times must people do this accidentally anyway, never mind having it done deliberately by a Virgin staff member? I now face a lengthy battle to get my money back and I'm pursuing both companies - I'm incensed that Virgin think they have the right to interfere with someone else's property and am also very concerned that the Trainline app has absolutely no safeguards against either accidental activation or mistaken activation. I wish to high heaven that I'd just gone and got paper tickets instead.I will never, ever, use an app for any kind of ticketing in the future. I thought I was saving time by using the app. Instead it's landed me in debt. BEWARE!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-07-03T11:11:14Z	Rail and Sale purchase that was not fit for purchase	We purchased rail and sail tickets (North Wales station to Dublin) through the Virgin trains web site. There were 4 options in the 24 hours. We picked a package that gave us a train ticket and ferry ticket.  We paid £5 extra for the option which was the train journey and ferry ticket that got us on the fast boat over to Ireland. Unfortunately the train was delayed by 12 minutes. The result was that we were unable to get on the fast ferry and had to wait 2 hours for the next boat, which as it was a slower ferry meant a delay of 4 hours.  There was a whole train of people affected.  Irish ferries told us that we should not have been sold the ticket.  Virgin has told us that the train operator Arriva is responsible not them. When I pointed out to Virgin that they had sold us something not fit for purpose - the train if on time only gets in 30 minutes before the departure of the fast ferry and the close of check in is 30 minutes before departure, so why were they selling the train journey, they stated that the check in closes 30 minutes before departure or on the arrival of the connecting train - when I said this did not happen, Virgin said they could not comment as it was another companies decision.  Virgin are still selling this package, no other train option is given for the fast ferry (ie an earlier train), I have advise them to put the warning on the booking page that if the train is delayed by 10 minutes they will not be able to get the boat, so at least people are warned and can decide whether they want to waste money on a boat they may not be able to get.  Virgin have completely washed their hands of this, taking no liability for selling the package on their web site. Appalling customer service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

However, my boyfriend is in the forces and has been deployed away for 4 months quite suddenly. We booked the train for our last week together before he left and obviously were devastated when we couldnt go. I asked the trainline if they could refund it and they said yes but at a charge of £40. However, my mother and I would be travelling to the same destination in two months time. They refused to swap the tickets over and charged more for the same journey in august PLUS the £40. Both virgin and the trainline agreed to this and wouldnt refund us. They wouldnt even take money off our next journey. They spoke to us like dirt and GREEDILY took our money. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. My boyfriend is off defending our country and these greedy companies dont care and have no empathy. I am also a student so £40 is a big deal to me.

I have taken to travelling and couple of hours before any major meetings as I have been delayed so many times. But this week was even worse. I was told my ticket was invalid on the London to York service I was on - even though I had been told otherwise - and the 'revenue protection officer' tried to make me pay an extra £129. After the unhelpful guard had told me which train my ticket was valid on (including that same train after Peterborough - but I couldn't stay on it as I hadn't joined it there?!) I was told by the guard on the next train that my ticket wasn't valid on that service either! Anyway, I eventually got home much later than planned, and it had to involve a £30 taxi ride home as I missed the last train. Awful treatment by Virgin. I had been representing the UK in Brussels and chose to get the train. Next time I'll fly.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

I have put up with the rising train fares, crowded carriages and broken toilets. Recently I have had a death in the family and had to arrange a trip back home. In my emotional state I accidentally through away my return ticket thinking it was the receipt. I spoke with there helpline and ticket office and train conductors and was so told there was nothing they can do and I had to purchase a new ticket costing me £85.50. I think it is disgusting that in 8 years of travel with virgin train they weren't able to help me in my hour of need. I would have even beared a coat of a reprint, but apparently there was nothing they could do. I will not be travelling with virgin trains again.

2017-07-03T11:11:14Z	Online booking not fit for purpose	absolutely useless. Virgin's online booking gave me a series of m-tickets when I asked for real tickets because they need to be distributed among a bunch of elderly people who do not use mobile phones. Moreover, the travellers are coming from different parts of the country. When calling their helpline to get the useless m-tickets swapped the ONLY swap-option they could offer was to CANCEL the entire booking and rebook ensuring 'self-print' was selected. In this case the number of seats booked and the closeness to the time of departure meant that there was absolutely no guarantee that the tickets would still be available at all (let alone the same price). Virgin's system is clearly at the 'alpha' stage of development and not even ready for 'beta' release.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-07-03T11:11:14Z	Stealing every penny from customers	One of the worst customer services I have ever encountered. I had purchased 2 tickets for July 16th instead of 17th. Changed them paying the fare difference plus 10 GBP per passenger. The balance refund was due after I send the old tickets via recorded delivery. Can't think of a more greedy company than VT to have refunded only for ticket, stating that they only received one ticket. I am absolutely sure I sent two. No point in walking up to the post office, paying for recorded delivery and sending only one ticket when I am sure that they only refund upon receiving them. The human machines in call center impractical, unaccommodating and powerless. Had to call them 3 times over 3 weeks to know the status of my complaint to be eventually told that the back office staff only received one ticket.Embezzlers to the core.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-07-03T11:11:14Z	Always choose VT over LM	I get the train every day for work, and can choose between the Virgin service and the London midland service. The Virgin always has seats, is fast, comfortable, and generally is on time. The onboard shop is expensive but you expect that. Compare that with the London Midland, which is always overcrowded, hot, and a generally unpleasant experience. I choose the Virgin train whenever I can.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4

2017-07-03T11:11:14Z	Clever way to con their customers!	Wow, terrible customer service, staff who give completely conflicting information and a very clever way to fleece their customers.  Avoid at all cost and look forward to them losing the franchise for the rail route in due course.  Their booking system made a mix up on my booking so the trains were booked in the wrong order.  When I raised this in advance of the journey they said that I would need to pay a 10GBP charge to amend the ticket, but that each one had to be treated completely seperately as opposed to being viewed as one ticket.  This allows them to double their money as the total cost of the new journey should be the same as the original one they booked but the price of the tickets are inverted so a 17GBP ticket now cost 88GBP and vice versa.  Essentially by treating it as two seperate bookings they can charge me double the cost than they would if they just treated it as one booking meaning I'm now over 100GBP down on this trip due to a mistake made by their booking system.  To make matters worse the staff at the station said no one in management had any autority to use discretion to make it fair, albeit they admitted it was completely ridiculous for me to be forced to pay twice for it. Disgraceful	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

I travelled for the first time today and before your pathetic defence of it being a bank holiday - I wish I had gone back to Heathrow even after the fiasco of yesterday's cancellations. It was literally a stampede at Kings X when the platform was announced only to find that EVERY seat was reserved, creating havoc as people crammed the train but could not sit down as only a handful of passengers had actually reserved seats. Why we're all the seats showing a reservation if they weren't?It's truly shameful for so many tourists to pay £100's if they have to stand in a cold train with no food/drink to Edinburgh for over 4 hours.NEVER EVER AGAIN. Roll on nationalisation. It simply could not be more appalling than this cattle transport.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2017-06-01T14:53:21Z	Horrendous online then phone services.	Horrendous online then phone services.Booked a return ticket online to depart in 2 weeks. Had to change the date to an earlier departure day but wasn't allowed to 'amend/refund' online believe it or not because the supposed link actually doesn't permit this when clicked via My Account...why?Phoned up and explained I need to bring the date forward. All seem fine and the operator amended the departure date and said he would refund the original ticket minus £10 admin.  No problem as it is in the terms. So all sorted or so I believe.  Original return ticket being partially refunded and new ticket for a return trip with an earlier departure date booked.  Not so fast!  Ticket comes through as a Single!!!!!   Call immediately to sort out and told I would have to book another ticket for the trip I wanted i.e. the return and they will take 24-48 hours to investigate and if, and only if, it is their fault I will get a full refund otherwise I will have to pay another fee for their fault.  So far no offer of any refund has actually been made.  This means I have paid for the same trip, albeit I wanted to change the date 3 times and if they decide I must pay £10 twice.  Once is fine, after all I did choose to change the date on the original return ticket but it is unfair to tell me I will have to pay another £10 to correct or refund the ticket they issued as a single incorrectly.Why would you replace a return ticket with a single when all that was needed was to amend the date?Several emails later they tell me don't worry we investigate and if its our fault you'll get a full refund.  After which you can go ahead and purchase a new ticket.  Clearly they missed the bit about me already buying a replacement return ticket to replace the single one they issued incorrectly which should have bee the right one to replace the original one!They say however all calls are recorded and so far they have neither confirmed or declined my requests for copies of the voice recordings which clearly show I asked 3 times for the operator to confirm the ticket is a return, and the only change is the date of travel.  The travel is in one day so 48 hours obviously doesn't work for me and again they missed that bit in my emails.So I have to wait for them to investigate (and I do hope they haven't lied about calls being recorded!) to:1.  get my refund.2. find out if they will change me £10 for their incompetence3. find out if their incompetent operator has indeed refunded the original ticket and refunded the £58.95 minus £10 (£48.95) to my payment card.This is reported to be a competent company, with high standards and customer service.

Unfortunately the card did not arrive in time and I was planning on showing the purchase details of the card with the expiration date, passenger names and reference number as proof that we had purchased a card it simply didn't arrive in time for our journey. The train manager was very rude and abrupt saying about the terms and conditions of the train tickets and we had to purchase complete new tickets, even though she acknowledged that the information on my account proved I had purchased a rail card.. The tickets were FAR more expensive than online prices meaning we will be paying over £400 pounds in total for our journey. This seems like taking advantage of passengers who have made honest mistakes. It does not seem like a system that is set up in the interests of the customer and entraps them into paying extortionatly   large sums of money, also the customer service was appalling. We were treated like criminals when me and my pregnant wife are paying customers. Really disappointed. Probably​ will be taking the car from now on. I understand you have a system but I feel there must be some leeway in the face of extenuating circumstances which doesn't involve robbing customers blind! I will be sharing this experience with friends and family advising them to avoid Virgin trains on the basis that it is an unfriendly and unfair service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2017-06-01T14:53:21Z	East Coast Easter Meltdown	Bought tickets early for return Easter trip to Inverness from Kings Cross. Website would not allow me to RESERVE seats and I was unaware that I could do so at a later date.I asked at KC where unreserved  seating could be found (our first time on Virgin - and definitely our last)- there was NONE. Played musical chairs all the way to Edinburgh. Train arrived 15 mins late causing us to miss Scotrail connection to Perth. Lost an hour waiting for next train to Perth. Lost another hour at Perth for next train to Inverness.  Arrived 2 hours late for a group dinner at the hotel.WORSE to come on return journey!  I had learned that seats could be reserved at any station, so, the day before the return journey, I got seat numbers for Inverness to Edinburgh but was told I could not do so for Edinburgh to London. Bottom line was- train bursting at the seams, bodies everywhere: could not get to toilets (an hour later, they were 'out of order') without stepping over tens of people. My wife (aged 70) had to sit on the carriage floor from Newcastle to London. I stood.  Train manager then announced catering was shutting down (not that you could have reached the refreshment car). He later announced that he understood many of us were 'quite irate' but that if Virgin had any more trains, they would have put them on.  IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE TRAINS - DON'T SELL THE TICKETS !!I took one look at the Virgin complaints procedure and nearly lost the will to live. We expected Easter Monday to be busy, but this is completely unacceptable, both for the scores (if not hundreds)of people with unreserved seats and those with reserved seats who could not move around to the toilet or bar and had bodies jostling them the whole journey. Virgin should not be allowed to get away with this, but what can  I do about it?  And how can we all get our money back?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

I have to cancel the booking, get a refund and start again. Or, if closer to the booking, probably lose it. Seriously? Go to an airline, even with a restricted ticket, or even with Virgin East Coast, and swap your seat. After all, you're not changing train time or date. Simply a seat? The most customer-unfriendly approach you can take. I will go by car before I endorse this approach again. The feedback was: ""you are amending, and that's a 'change' so you can't"". Sure, restrict ticket elements. I get that: date and time. But a seat? Get real. Its taking 'restricted' to another level."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2017-06-01T14:53:21Z	awful train, WORSE customer service.	I took a Virgin train to London in March, and I have never experienced such a bad journey before.The train was incredibly old, weird short chairs which made my knees incredibly achy and with grotty metal trays that were impossible to put down and use as a table as they actually rested on my knees (and I'm 5.2''...). Furthermore, there were NO plug sockets. I did not receive any information prior to my journey to state that the train would have no plug sockets so ended up arriving in London with a dead mobile phone which was less than ideal. Perhaps more annoying was the fact that I was going to work on the train for my two hour journey, but could not because there was nothing to plug my laptop into. A loss of two hours work is A LOT for me in terms of money.I tried to do my best coping with knowing my phone was going to die before I reached London and knowing that I would be behind with work and end up having to work on my holiday in London.But then I decided to go to the toilet. The toilet in itself was not so bad (I don't expect train toilets to be perfect), but when I went to wash my hands, after putting soap on one of them, I realised that the tap was stuck, and what's more, it was BOILING HOT.I ended up leaving the toilet covered in soap and with a fairly sore hand. Having not washed my hands, and also with my hands being very sticky, I was unable to eat the food that I had taken on board with me.I have emailed Virgin asking for my money back, but they have only so far sent me an automatic email reply (which for some unknown reason arrived about two weeks after I sent my original complaint...).I replied to the automated email with the information it had requested, and also asked how long it would be until I received an email back (as  it only says that 'you’ll receive a personal reply from a member of the Customer Relations Team in due course' in the automatic reply, which is completely unhelpful), but yet after almost two weeks I have no reply to thisThe fact that Virgin Trains think it is ok to ignore people is really the final straw here and unless they provide me with a refund in the next 5 days I will be taking my business elsewhere..	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2017-05-01T13:41:27Z	Virgin Trains Android plus Customer Service	I used their Android app (for the first time) to buy my train ticket. The payment went through - it always does doesn't it - but the tickets could not be generated / downloaded. The message was 'Contact Customer Service'. As it was 1AM, I left it until the morning: surely they could resolve the website  glitch by then. In the morning, at the station - no tickets, same message. No phone number, no reference, 10 min before the train. Bought a regular ticket. Got to the Customer Service ~1 h later (you have to study the app to find contact numbers), explained what happened. No interest shown, was suggested to cancel the ticket for a standard  £10 fee (for  £15 ticket). Complained in writing. Was told off, twice. Still cannot understand what I have done wrong. Sure, a cozy monopoly on rail travel plus a third-world country customer service makes it a nice business model.

However, on the way back my train was held at a station due to a power failure at Euston. I got home via other routes and was told I could claim compensation online. I did so - it was an easy, straight-forward process requiring me to scan/photo my tickets and upload them. Within a week I was pleasantly surprised to receive a full refund of my whole return ticket!! No hassle, no quibble, and a nice letter.

On both occasions, the train was totally over crowded. Last weekend, it was the fault of the Grand National apparently that more people were traveling. Was Virgin taken by surprise by this event then? I would like to understand why first class tickets are sold for obviously busy journeys and then are not honoured either in terms of seating or refreshments.

The attitude was so positive, and in the end the assistance was sorted. She also said that the care on her inward  journey ( also not organised) was also excellent.

I have no other means to pay for replacements until this is refunded to me, by then it will be too late to book anything else at a reasonable price. Total miss selling and rubbish treatment of customers. Anyone hoping to get to Glasgow from Manchester via Carlisle on 29th April will be sadly disappointed and won't know a thing about it until they turn up for the non existent service.

Over a month and no reply at all beyond the automatic acceptance emails (even when registering a formal complaint) is unacceptable. It smacks of sharp practice (i.e. make it as difficult as possible to claim compensation for delays so that most people give up). Appalling company. If you have a choice then pick a different rail company.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-05-01T13:41:27Z	Awful Company	Just take a megabus, at least they have plug sockets - dirty, overcrowded, uncomfortable as hell experience. For the prices they charge, the customer care is shocking	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-05-01T13:41:27Z	Disgraceful lack of customer care.	I lost my return ticket from Euston  to Preston and had to buy another at a cost of £88. I showed the  customer service person my email proof of purchase but she wasn't interested. I understand the responsibility is mine but surely they could issue some sort of receipt for the ticket collector.They said no as the original ticket could still be used but I was going to be sitting on MY original seat next to my partner so how could anyone else use my ticket ? Very shoddy customer service .	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-05-01T13:41:27Z	Never again	virgin trans allow bookings on nominated trains without a reserved seat this could involve a 5 hr journey with children, standing. Surely this is wrong.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-05-01T13:41:27Z	no sense	Why are new Virgin train carriages worse than older ones in terns of access to 02? Why are we burning co2 gases to heat trains and burn up oxygen to the point that it feels like travelling in 40 degrees in India rather than 10 degrees in March in the UK... Horrible journey; a 21c train with no window openings or air conditioning facility!  Great incubation carriages for bug transfer but impossible to sit  for any length ( I sweated for 1/2 hour before leaving for teh corridor outside!)I suggest  that fellow sufferers move to the corridor outside the toilets...shame is there are no seats and  no refunds.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-05-01T13:41:27Z	Travelling Virgin? Bring an oxygen mask	Worthy of particular contempt was a smelly, unwashed, self-important and greasy curly haired halfwit in Edinburgh (get a haircut and put on some deodorant) who told barefaced lies about the process of booking seats	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-05-01T13:41:27Z	Worse than trains in India	My mother was reavelling up to see me,her daughter in Chester At Euston she was helped by Aliona. I have to say that Aliona was very helpful and kind she looked after my mum and made her feel very safe and secure I was a little worried about my mum traveling on her own, I know she is a very independent lady but her eye sight  is failing and she does need help My mum and I would like to say a big thank you to a very lovely caring employee Virgin should be very proud of you Thank you Maxine Bowler-Byrne	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	Thre my daughter off the train.	my daughter uses these trains all the time and she forgot her railcard so went and notified the office at her train station n they said if she had her online account as proof that would be fine so she got on the train and whem they came along ahe showed her ticket and then asked for her railcard and my daughter told the conducter everytging and he threw her off she did nog know where she was and we had to pay £83 for a ticket she got kicked off a train even tho she had a ticket......my point is that coz she needed proof if her railcard in the 1st place to buy her ticket she done as she was told by the station assistant and he still threw her off the train she was in tears upset is an understatment she is 20 and travels alone so yeh i am taking this further shame you have to give 1 star to make a comment in the 1st place...seeking legal action over this its not on.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	Stole £117 from me	Only printed the first half of the return journey from Edinburgh to London, the staff refused to do anything and I had to pay £137 for a single to get back home. On emailing to complain they confirmed there was an error and they'd look into it. 3 and a half weeks later they write back to say the computer has said printed the tickets and it was my fault for leaving it in the machine but the would return the original £20 I paid for the advanced ticket leaving me £117 out of pocket.Terrible company, I would advise never using them	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	Appalling Customer Service Delay and Repay	I have been trying to get delay and repay which should have gone through automatically as booked on my Virgin.Com  account get no replies from emails sent to them? no helps from online chat service and the customer service telephone number wont take calls refers you to online chat ! Have even tried emailing Phil Whittingham MD of Virgin West coast no reply from his email either appalling something needs to be done about them!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	Disgraceful Customer Service	"After 6 months we have still not received delay compensation. Initially filled in their online claim form. Waited 3 months no sign of any compensation. Wrote to them and was bounced around a bit until I was asked to resubmit details of journey again. After waiting again for over a month contacted them again and pointed out that they had already received their payment from Network Rail for the delay so where was mine. Waited again and then asked what train I was on. Fortunately I still had the seat reservation sent that off and reminded them that the whole trip was booked via their web site so they should have a record anyway. Usual reply ""wait ten working days "". It doesn't take 6 months to buy a ticket so why should we have to wait 6 months for compensation. From my contact with them it would appear that they are not interested in customer service. Disgraceful."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	We're Sorry	All I will say is that if Virgin were as good at running a service as they are at saying sorry, I'd probably be a happy customer.Every journey has at least one apology for some sort of service shortcoming..	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	fast but expensive	bieng a uni student i love the service of vigin trains because its very fast and gets to birmingham from london within 1 an a half hours but then sometimes it costs around £100 per trip where as the national express  £20 is the maximum return tickets sometimes even in last minutes so if the target is to save time go for virgin trains but if you have an extra hour i would say go for national express. thanks	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	If I was CEO, I would've fired this staff on the spot.	I was in the first car, which was fairly empty. Between Penrith and Carlisle, it sounded like a hen party for all the attendants sitting in the back, talking and laughing.  Honestly, embarrassing for them, I had to ask for hot tea. How hard would it have been to check with me and the only other person in the car if they needed anything?  They have it much too easy, apparently.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	Rip-off	Sadistically overpriced. Overcrowded trains: unsafe number of people in carriages (was once given a ticket with no seat reservation from London to Edinburgh, with people crammed into the carriages and left to stand). Uncomfortable seats with no leg room once you do get one. Patronising marketing and design (writing under mirror: 'Go on, give us a smile!'. Not worth the ridiculous price.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	Travel 50 weeks a year and after trying Virgin Trains I will never go near anything Virgin,	Travel 50 weeks a year and never complain but after trying Virgin Trains I will never go near anything Virgin again.  I just spent 200+ pounds on tickets for a weekend getaway. Chose the Virgin Train service instead of driving as I knew I would have an extremely exhausting week. Despite having booked online a specific departure (late Friday ex. London). Upon arrival in good time to the train I was told by the conductor (despite my email confirmation saying “We've saved your seats- Log in to see where you're sat”) that this is one of the heaviest departures and there is never any room. We ended up standing up squeezed in by other travellers in front of the WC for 3 hours. An absolutely wasted 200 pounds, and I chose to fly back instead as I did not want the same experience.In short: I went on line , assuming that buying a ticket for a selected departure, and sent to checkout paying 200 pounds, that this would actually include a seat on THAT train. Apparently that’s not how it works, and clearly Virgin will go as far as directly misleading you to buy a train seat that is not there. In any other industry this would be criminal. Think of it, Virgin clearly knew there is no room but yet they happily sell you the ticket for a specific departure and sending you a booking summary for it.  Clearly Sir Richards success model is based in conning consumers these days.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	customer service phone line is a joke	I received vouchers in lieu of being delayed for 4 hours on a stationary train.  You have to call Virgin to redeem them and then you have to send the voucher by special delivery to their Edinburgh office and they post you the tickets.  I had all of my details pre-prepared and rang to book 4 journeys.  Their call centre is in India so it wasn't clear that the staff had fully understood what I'd booked so I checked the booking and one return journey had been made for the wrong month.  I rang them back and they advised me that I had to wait 72 hours before they could check the phone call recording and make sure the error was theirs and not mine.  As one of the booked journeys was only 2 weeks away I sent the voucher to Edinburgh with a letter clearly explaining that one of the bookings attached to the reference number was incorrect.  Three days later I received all of the tickets including those for the incorrect train journey.  Did no-one bother to read the letter?  I have had to ring the call centre a third time and ask why no-one has got back to me about the incorrect  booking.  They checked the booking and said there was a note to say it was their error and they agreed to re-book it for the correct dates.  I had to pay for the new booking and send the wrong tickets back to Edinburgh and await a refund.  So, they compensate me for a delayed train and then I have to spend hours on the phone and writing letters and pay £6 for special delivery twice and pay up front for a ticket that should be complimentary and then wait for a refund.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	Liverpool lime st closed	I am not one for entering reviews. But using Runcorn stn today due the landslide at Liverpool lime st.  Virgin had made the effort  to look after its customers, with plenty of boots on the ground.  The staff were  helpful and friendly.  Well done virgin.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	Great journey	The train was very impressive just looking st the outside. I was sat in first class and it felt as if I was in a plane. The train was very long and looked after. Was treated to free food and drink of which we're both very nice. The train was quiet and very fast. An overall perfect experience you want when traveling the country. I'll be using this way of travelling from now on.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	Manic, but a one-off	People from 3 different-timed trains directed to only one, coach D (my reservation) was apparently non-existent and we were eventually told to go to coach C, wherein the reserved seats were already completely blocked up by people on coach C, who were then told to go to coach F? Terrible planning in the Ace of cancellations, but I've been on Virgin Trains before and it's been completely smooth and an easy journey. Don't think I will be travelling with them again, though, in case something like this happens again	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	More Than Adequately Compensated	I had my railcard withheld by an incompetent manager at the Edinburgh Travel Centre in October of last year on the premise that it had been altered-which it had not. Subsequently I was late for a job interview in London and was left feeling very angry and stressed by this. I made a number of complaints about this, especially about the manager concerned and have today received complimentary first class tickets to London by way of compensation.This has way exceeded my expectations and is greatly appreciated. It is quite apparent from this that Virgin East Coast took my complaints seriously and that they value their customers. This has restored my faith in the company.Very impressed,Visited October 2016	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	Con-artists	I bought a ticket for a virgin train which I subsequently missed by one minute (despite running) as there were works going on at one of the underground stations which delayed my journey. When I went to the ticket office to explain they told me there was nothing they could do other than pay for a new ticket and get a different service. They would not refund my ticket and said I would have to get in touch with southeastern about a possible refund. It is unbelievable that you can pay £65 for a ticket and then have such an appallingly bad service. If I could give no stars I would. Rude, incompetent and money-grabbing!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	Rude male staff	I am very hard of hearing and didn't catch the description of what was on offer to eat. When the man came round I asked him to repeat it he said it was repeated twice and wouldn't let me know what was on offer he was very rude. I will not travel virgin again if this is the way passengers are treated especially with a disability.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	Non-existent customer complaints response	Travelled London Euston-Coventry on 5/12/16. Bought Ist Class ticket. Lack of staff, meant that there was no at seat refreshment service. Only provision was a 'free' hot drink from the on-board shop. Told that we had to buy the sandwiches that we had already paid for! Used Virgin's on-line form to complain. Got an almost immediate response thanking me for 'my feedback', with no explanation or apology. Clearly a proforma letter. Replied that I was complaining not giving feedback, and that I expected an explanation & details of their policy for dealing with situations like this. Since then I have heard nothing. After 30 days, I wrote to the MDs office - again no response. Today I tried to contact their Customer Relations Department again. Their phone-line had a message saying that they were too busy to take calls and to use their LiveChat facility. I did this waited 45 minutes in a queue of 11, got to 1, it then cut out with a message saying that it was too busy to to respond to LiveChat !Won't be using Virgin Trains again, if I can avoid it. What a great shame that what had used to be a responsive company with a good service, has descended to this.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	2 Hour+ Journey not heating	1st time I have ever been on a virgin train Kings Cross to Leeds. No heating on the train. I was freezing! I had to use my gloves as my hands were stinging. When we reached Leeds we were shivering with the cold. What a rubbish Service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	ruined our treat	"I fell for the advertising on the east coast line and took my son for an overnight stay in Durham.Booked 1st Class so we could have the, highly advertised, evening meal which was why we went 1st class. It worked well on the outward journey and we had a nice evening meal.Coming back to London, we boarded hungry and tired and looking forward to our meal. The announcement came immediately: due to staff shortages no dinner. Stale sandwiches were offered. Cynically I wondered if it was because this train wasn't full so it wasn't worth it for them.After almost 2MONTHS I received a reply saying: ""the catering provided in 1st Class is complimentary and offered subject to availability.""I scoured the advert and saw nothing to that effect. On the contrary It sounded guaranteed that hot meals were served every night in the week after 5.30pm on that line.Should have been a nice end to a treat, something I could ill-afford. Instead we arrived home hungry and mad.Won't be falling for their blurb again."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2017-03-16T13:14:12Z	First Class was much better before Virgin	"First class used to be nice!! Nice hot meals have been replaced by ""a gourmet sausage roll with gourmet chutney""!! If you've just paid out for a first class ticket do you really want a sausage roll?!? There used to be nice cakes when it was East Coast! They've disappeared!! The nice sandwiches have been replaced by dodgy bacon sarnies and a houmous wrap where the houmous layer was so thin that they seem to have made a scientific breakthrough by splitting the houmous atom!! Used to get a cup of tea - now that gets offered to me 10 seconds before we roll into Peterborough and I don't ever really feel like a tea shot ""down in one""!!And although I am moaning about poor sandwich quality I rarely get to have them as they are usually offered to me shortly after Huntingdon! Probably another cost-cutting brainwave - ""I know - loads of people get off at P'boro so offer them tea and snacks 40 minutes after they leave Kings Cross!!"".We are always told that nationalised industries are hopelessly ""inefficient"" and that companies like Virgin and Stagecoach can handle matters with far more business competency. But if that means I spend the whole journey thinking ""where's my tea?"" and ""my goodness those sausage rolls look dreadful"" then I say bring back the inefficiency of nationalisation!!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-02-02T01:08:00Z	Trains were fine (even when disrupted) but NO customer service	Before I start, I have been on trains before to London and they were fine. Yes, now and again something can go wrong but there is a level of acceptance from both ends, which can be rectified and sorted out either there and then, or by the customer service later. But being denied entry to a train that I have booked and have a reservation, then being told to get the next one in an hour, with no seat reservation, and wait an extra 30mins for the driver to turn up.... all the while wondering whether or not I was going to be stuck at my transfer destination of York because no more trains were running.... NOT acceptable. How about you honor your agreement and allow your customers to get on the train that they paid for, and sit in the seat that is reserved for them! I didn't make it to the destination I paid for, so had to pay £20 extra for a taxi on top of the disruption that was caused to my journey . Even still, when I sent a message to Virgin trains, I got a reply saying its not their problem pretty much, rather it was a different part of Virgin trains that is responsible and they will forward the message. I waited 2 months for a reply....NOTHING. Then sent another message, with an automated response saying I will hear from them in 10 days. It has been 40 days! What a joke!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2017-02-02T01:08:00Z	Very poor customer service	I am very disappointed with Virgin trains customer service. Because my friend who is a registered blind person had his ticket stolen while on a visit to London he had to buy a replacement ticket from Virgin ticket staff at Euston they told us we would be able to reclaim the cost of £39.50 by supplying a crime number to Customer services. However Virgin customer services have decided to ignore that promise. I have also involved London travel watch who have apealed to Virgin on my behalf without success. London Travel watch have told me that they are very disappointed with Virgin trains attitude over this matter. I am very sad that Virgin trains have been so hard hearted towards my friend and my self.I shall be contacting the media about this	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-02-02T01:08:00Z	Grubby small minded company	Why do companies like Virgin think its fine to overcharge their customers? Why does Virgin blatantly lie to customers about prices when purchasing tickets?Why does Virgin limit customers to one train when purchasing tickets? Why does Virgin only sell Single tickets when a return ticket is requested? Why do Virgin staff feel its fine to make life difficult for its customers?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-02-02T01:08:00Z	Out of there way for a gluten free lady	I wanted to write a review as I felt the Virgin train staff on the 12.57 from Liverpool Lime Street to London Euston virgin were bloody brilliant. I have been diagnosed with a gluten intolerance recently and find it difficult to find food on the go unless I buy it from a supermarket and make it myself. I was travelling first class and mentioned that I could not have there choice in sandwiches as I was gluten free. Ken told me not to worry he would make me a bacon buttie with gluten free rolls. I was thrilled! I also wanted to say a big thank you to Kev on the same service who was really friendly and nothing was to much trouble. They both made my journey great and made my day. Thanks guys :-)	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2017-02-02T01:08:00Z	Lack of Flexibility and Support	Unfortunately, I had a negative experience with Virgin Trains. I had already purchased a very expense round-trip ticket, and after I had used my departure ticket to get on my first train, I dropped it and couldn’t find it. I still had my return ticket and receipt for the trip, however Virgin would not print me a new ticket to use to complete my journey. I also could not use the ticket on my mobile device. Instead, I was forced to buy a new single way ticket for 82 pounds. This being my first time in England using the train, I felt very taken advantage of. I thought the service of the train was great, but unfortunately I do not think I would use it for my future travels because of the lack of understanding and flexibility on the part of the train line.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-02-02T01:08:00Z	Complete Joke	Virgin basically let us cook on a train for a 4 hour journey with no air conditioning. The staff told us on that if we put in a complaint online and kept the tickets there would be some form of compensation - it has been 6 months and still no reply from them. I have tried email and social media however they just give me the run around and ignore me another big company which does not care about its customers would whenever possible not book with them.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-02-02T01:08:00Z	Does virgin have morals?	On the 4:30 train to Edinburgh to London Kings Cross in coach E. Was looking forward to a peaceful journey when all passengers were interrupted by the conductor arguing unfairly with two tourists who had gotten on the wrong train. The outcome was he refunded one friend and the other friend had to pay. They had gotten a train 20 minutes earlier by accident as they never realised that there were two different trains. They were treated so unfairly and this should not happen to anyone. My mum and I had gotten a train before hand and were told we could catch any train at any time as long as we had the tickets yet they were told differently and completely humiliated.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-02-02T01:08:00Z	Packed train, no wifi as stated, no customer service	Included with ticket price Wifi did not work, no one on train can help, 10 min wait for IT helpline & every time get cut off as one is on a train.  Gave up after 5 calls.One guard for huge train London King's Cross to Edinburgh of ~10 carriages x 78 seats.  So one guard for 700+ seats.  So if you do need assistance forget about it.  There is only one of him.  Only thing you can rely on is your ticket will be checked.Very limited staff on whole train. 1 guard, 1 bar, 1 tea lady, one driver.  Is that it four people?Good thing no delays.  Not really happy though.

2017-02-02T01:08:00Z	Best train Manager Hands Down	Back in the summer, I and 3 others had bought tickets to travel to Edinburgh on a very early morning train- we were to meet at Coventry station,but the taxi company I had booked disappointed me- to cut the story short I missed my train- I wanted to die a slow death and the virgin train staff advised that it was up to the discretion of the train manager on the next train to decide if he would agree to take me on..he did- that's when I really should have written this review but I did not.Anyway- fast forward to 23/12/2016 on the 16.42 train to Edinburgh from Coventry and I saw the same train manager again. I wanted to thank him for what he had done for me, how grateful I was blah blah blah. He actually remembered me ( I must have been begging for him to take me on his train on the previous occasion- did I mention that I was going to see my boyfriend hence the begging :-).This train manager is a gem of a gentleman, best customer service I have ever received. His name is C. J and I should have asked what that stands for but I am sure there are not many C.J's on the London Edinburgh line.Whoever this managers manager is needs to know that C.J went over and above his duty to accommodate me and ensure I got to Edinburgh. I am so grateful and I really cannot sing his praises enough.Happy New year to you all... A very happy Virgin train customer....Bernie.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5

2017-02-02T01:08:00Z	Atrocious Customer Service and advice.  Will not book with Virgin Trains again!	We needed to change our Outward journey due to Sky dictating kick-off times.  Called Virgin Trains who told me to book new tickets and post back old ones for refund to credit card, less £10 for each ticket returned. Slavishly obeyed with tickets sent with proof of postage. After approx. 4 weeks still no refund to credit card. Called Virgin Trains who accepted they had had tickets back but they were non-refundable!! I complained that I had been given wrong advice previously but told a manager would call me within 24 to 48 hours after listening to recording of initial call.  No call from manager after 3 to 4 days so called back. This time told the following: they would need to check tickets had been returned that call-backs from a manager would be within next 4 hours and that I there was every possibility that credit would be within next 2 to 3 days.  Guess what - I'm going to make yet another call to Virgin Trains and speak to someone in their atrocious Customer services department. Like a previous reviewer I'd like to leave a NO STAR rating.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-02-02T01:08:00Z	My first long distance journey	Not just my first long distance journey but my first time in First Class.I traveled from Leamington Spa via Birmingham International, where I picked up the Virgin train, to Edinburgh Waverley and returned 4 days later. Getting the seat bookings was rather complicated and involved me making a complaint and demanding to speak to a supervisor to get it sorted, which he did within minutes. Unfortunately I was told to print out the seat reservations at a ticketing machine at any station. I tried 2 separate stations and it wouldn't work, so had to queue for 20 mins+ to get them on the day of the journey.. But I have absolutely no complaints about anything once I was on the train. The journey up was the restricted weekend service, which was fine and the journey back was excellent. So much food & drink, I couldn't manage it all! We used the first class lounge at Waverley both ways and really appreciated the free WiFi,,papers, on tap tea & coffee,biscuits etc. Not that we needed to, but you could even have a shower there! I really couldn't fault Virgin once we got on the train. On the way back there was a problem at Birmingham, nothing to do with Virgin and they really kept us updated. We even managed to change trains at a different station and get back to Leamington earlier than expected!Would I travel Virgin again - yesIs the extra for First Class worth it? Most definitely.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4

2017-02-02T01:08:00Z	If I could rate 0 stars, I would	I am appalled with Virgin Trains and the way my colleague and I have just been treated by their employees. We are in London on a business trip and purchased our tickets in advance. When we got to the station in Manchester, we asked one of the Virgin Trains employees to look at our e-ticket and tell us where to go and they pointed to one of the trains and told us to go there. We got on the train and were approached by one of their employees who asked for our tickets and ended up charging us (again!) 85 GBP because we accidentally got on a train that was 10 minutes earlier (even though we were directed to it by other Virgin Trains employees!). On top of it all, the employee was extremely rude and when we tried to explain the situation which caused our confusion, he threatened us that he'd involve the police. The whole trip ended up costing us over 200 GBP and we are absolutely shocked..	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-02-02T01:08:00Z	No refunds on E-tickets BEWARE	If you buy a ticket and choose to get an e-ticket you are no longer able to change the time/date of your train or get a refund. Even if you pay the admin fee. They hide this in their T&Cs. This wouldn't be acceptable in any other industry so don't know how they get away with this.Absolute disgrace considering how expensive their tickets already are.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2017-02-02T01:08:00Z	🚄 Good service	I travel from Preston to London Euston and Preston to Edinburgh using the Virgin Pendilino service at least 4 times a year and have done so for the last 5-6 years.Fact: trains are on timeFact: trains are generally pretty cleanFact: staff are always helpful and happyFact: internet okFact: value for moneyThe complaints on here are not representative as most people only post when something goes wrong. One complaint I read concerned some travellers thinking it was reasonable to play music through their phone and then post a negative review as the conductor asked them to switch it off quoting other passengers were not complaining. To these selfish people I say one thing why do I a paying traveller who may have just joined the train have to listen to your music. I suspect there were people that got on a simply found somewhere else to sit. Get real what would happen if every passenger played music? Use headphones in future,.Clearly the reviews are not balanced and likely to be one off instances.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4
2017-02-02T01:08:00Z	Unpleasant journey	We went to Newcastle from Kirkcaldy on 9th December 2016 and the train was absolutely freezing. The trip back wasn't quite so bad to start with, nice quite carriage we were playing music on our phone quietly with no additional speakers the conductor passed us and said turn that music off no eye contact he just continued walking and said it's not allowed on virgin train in any carraiges. VERY RUDE STAFF. We weren't  being noisy or rowdy and couldn't see anything saying we were not allowed to play music. We certainly were not disturbing anyone. We did ask the other 2 people near us and they said there wasn't a problem conductors attitude was shocking.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	True booking confusion and a miserable bunch of employees	"First experience with travelling and cannot believe the ridiculously poor booking system.  It's clear that some trains are faster and thus more expensive but it's very unclear that the slow one is the equivalent of riding the tube. After a incorrectly booked ticket and having to get another at the correct time (no sympathy, money lost) - I then paid £65 for first class but there wasn't anything that justified the price. Also it seems common place for everybody to just pile on regardless if they hold a first class ticket or not. The pricing on the page is not clear- they list standard tickets as off peak and off peak is put under trains that are not off peak. Did I mention it's impossible to tell what direction the train is travelling. I thought on the way home with my booked FC ticket on the fast service things would be better. I arrive, see my platform do go down and get on the train. I happen to look out and see it is a train leaving 20 minutes earlier. Figured it would be fine being not a single person is in the train car. Nope - the miserable guy setting things up might as well said get the hell off. I had an advanced ticket which he referred to as not full price. It is full price just not flexible. As the train is about to pull off I ask the manger who scathed at me with a too bad so sad attitude. Absolutely appalling customer ""service"". Avoid at all cost. Richard Branson should be ashamed putting his name in this business."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	Inhumane way of transporting people	Virgin trains are the pits, the worst most crowded inhumane way of transporting people, if you transported cattle in the same disgusting cramped conditions you would go to prison. My last journey was so bad that I had to get off the train and get a taxi back home, cancelling my journey, there were 27 of us crammed in the space between 2 carriages and the air was so thick and stale people were struggling to breathe. I will never travel by train again, i feel sorry for those who have no option. Disgusting service :(	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	DISABLED-UNFRIENDLY TRAVEL AND HATE-SPEECH USING STAFF	"Virgin Trains disgust me; specifically, the typical default behavior of the staff the employ at all levels disgusts me.As a disabled/partially blind traveller, I've suffered a number of regrettable incidents due to the intrinsic lack of decency and human qualities on display from Virgin Trains staff,  The first time, a young Asian man with a hostile manner and tone at Wolverhampton Station was barking something about changing to another concourse exit, not realising that I hadn't noticed he was addressing me (despite my overtly-displayed part-sighted lanyard). His shouting abruptly and rushing over to me in a threatening manner forced me to stop suddenly and collide with another traveller, hurting my head and arm in the process.I went to speak to a portly woman in a red coat (sporting a badge with 'Ticket Enforcement' or something equally ridiculous written on it) who basically wasn't interested in hearing any witness accounts or speaking to me in a civil fashion because she was clearly too lazy and ignorant..End result of my formal written complaint to their Customer Services dept.? You guessed it - no apology forthcoming, as they were just doing their jobs, apparently. Now to a few weeks ago at Birmingham station, my chaperone and I are in a hurry to get to Symphony Hall for a show, and when we queue to buy a ticket from the kiosk (explaining that there was no ticket machine in Oakengates where we'd got on, and no train conductor either) the young ticket-seller in customary red uniform (Ashley) decides to give my female chaperone a rude, condescending lecture in place of her ticket. I basically told him he'd no right to speak like that to her, and maybe if he's also said the same thing in the same way to the two gangsta-looking types before us in the queue buying tickets (he'd not squeaked a solitary word to them about not having tickets) then I might actually respect him or his opinions a little more than I did,Then a dispute ensued because he decided to throw his toys out and not to give her a ticket, then make us wait while he radioed for a colleague (throwing some curious insults my way in the process, to which I responded in kind). Then his red-shirt friend, a large black man weighed in (uninvited) to support him - despite not even being around when it kicked off - invading my personal space and looming in such a way I had to ask him to back away. Next up an old guy came over (not to help rectify the situation, but rather to defend his colleagues yet again) and proceeded to insult me about my sight-disability. Class move, old guy!End result of my formal written complaint to Virgin Trains CEO? See for yourselves below...""[TWIMC]Hello;May I suggest perhaps having a look at your cctv, or maybe asking Ms. D*****l for (an independent) deposition prior to directing claims of 'unsubstantiated complaint' my way -  based upon nothing bar the fact that weaselly little liars will tend to collude in order to squirm out of tight spots all of their own grubby making.I didn't ask you for any compensation because I don't require any from you - I wasn't even using Virgin Trains on the day in question, not that it seemed to concern that tall black kid in the red shirt with the aggressive body language and inappropriate comments.Also, I agree with you totally that the old guy who questioned the fact I'm disabled really does need some 'coaching'; some pretty extensive coaching if you ask me - or better still, voluntary redundancy.It strikes me as quite odd how your hierarchy all seem totally oblivious to what goes on at Network Rail stations on a daily basis. Staff clearly behave in a pig-ignorant, sullen manner because that is the type of mindset and behavior they've become ingrained with. There's not much point in decrying that when all you apologists always do is lay down excuses (my favorite one? Terror Threat Level: High Alert is the reason we talk to all customers like rude pigs...please).Don't worry too much tho', we all have a voice or a platform (no pun intended) these days - some more than others, in fact - and there are manifold ways to express the type of disgust and disdain we're talking about here.N.

As many of the ticket retailing staff at Birmingham New Street station are employed by Virgin Trains, this matter has been referred to ourselves. Please accept my apologies for the delay in reply whilst we investigated the concerns you have raised.

2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	The worst!	Actually the worst train service I've used. Worse than Southern Trains so that is saying something. I bought an advance ticket for London to Manchester , and for my return ticket didn't get a reservation even though I specified I would like a socket. Why is it killing you to have sockets with every seat like they do on Crosscountry and GWR? The only time you kind of get it right is when someone pays for first class, and even then clean toilets aren't a guarantee. A prime example of how privatisation of train service led to monopolisation of train services according to region. Lord help us when you take over all our healthcare.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	Useles	Just like all virgin companies virgin trains are a rip off and give terrible service. 0nce again my train from London to Birmingham new street (supposedly the flagship line) was cancelled. Once again the following train was delayed. Once again the train operator didn't bother announcing how late they are and when they are likely to reach new st. The train is currently 25 minutes after when it was supposed to be getting in and dawdling along at walking pace so no idea when it will get in. So I will be getting on for an hour late again and will have missed a number of ongoing connections. Do virgin care? I don't believe so as the one time I could be bothered to ask for a refund for a £176 ticket for a train which never went anywhere I have heard nothing 2 months later. I might as well get the slow trains for a fraction of the price rather than the 170 odd quid per day ticket or the £1000 plus season ticket I currently have. Not happy at all	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	Hit and miss	I never had any serious problems with Virgin Trains - on a good day travelling with them is very pleasant, on a worse one I feel like I paid way too much for a service that didn't meet my expectations. I also often splurge on 1st class tickets - on a weekday this is very much worth it (food, drinks including alcohol, wifi), on weekends it's just a bit more space and some free snacks. I recommend booking through their own site as if your train is delayed or cancelled, they provide an excellent reimbursement service!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4
2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	I just love sitting on the floor by the toilets!	Due to there being far too many passengers booked onto and far too few seats on our train, we spent the whole journey sitting on the floor next to the toilets in the area between carriages along with ten other fare paying passengers and their luggage. The aisles were also full of standing, fare payers thus making seated passengers comfort and experience of the fabulous Virgin Service severely compromised. At times I thought I was back in the 80's inter railing in rural Greece but then I realised it was more like a Michael Palin trip through deepest India, I was staggered that there were not people clinging to the outside of the carriages. What a truly horrible experience this was, Virgin should be ashamed of their operation. They promise a service they don't deliver. It is totally unacceptable to treat people like cattle in 2016. Absolutely rubbish Richard.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	Upsetting experience by catering staff	I travelled back from Leeds to London Kings Cross, from a work trip, on the 15:15 train from Leeds to London, Kings Cross.  After settling into a seat in Carriage D I decided that I would buy some refreshment for my journey.  After a while a FULLY STOCKED catering trolley came through the carriage.  It served some people in seats two rows ahead of me, then the lady (Rebecca – I think it was) quickly whizzed past me and served a gentleman behind me.  I asked TWICE if I could be served but the lady refused, just telling me “I’ll be back”.50 minutes later, the trolley re-appeared, whizzing past me yet again.  By this time we were just 30 minutes from journey’s end and it was too late to really get something to drink.  Even so, I wasn’t even asked!I was really upset as I am not used to being treated this way….and still felt upset the next day.  I really didn’t expect this sort of treatment from staff on a Virgin Train.I’m really disappointed in Virgin – not only for the way that I was treated, but for not apologising or endeavouring to ensure that it didn’t happen again.  This is no way to treat customers (or anyone else in fact) and I would be very reluctant to travel with Virgin again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	Awful service, persistent problem	I have to travel to London at least twice a year for family or work related purposes and usually go through Preston. Nearly always there seems to b a problem at Preston that delays the journey by hours - usually something that was known about in advance. Trains cancelled without notice, trains unable to go further without a train supervisor or a driver. I now fly to London rather than take train. I have just gotten off the phone to my sister who is stranded on a train that is sitting at Preston (on her way to Liverpool) and will not be going further. They are waiting for a staff member to appear to inform them what to do next. She has a course at 9am tomorrow. The likelihood is she will have to take a taxi from where she is and have to fight for reimbursement. At times like this Virgin staff are useless, rude, and evasive if they do appear however are mostly non-existent. Virgintrains...you are terrible. It infuriates me that you are often the only choice of rail service to go south.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	Shocking lack of any customer care, totally ignore e mails.	Recently I was delayed on a train journey, arriving over one hour late. This caused me to miss a birthday dinner, because of the delay. As you are able to claim a re-fund I contacted them by e mail on 5th November, they replied on 7th November saying they had forwarded my e mail to Customer care. As I heard nothing, I e mailed again on 18th November, and again on 24th November.  They just do not bother to reply.I wonder what Richard Branson would do if he knew, just how shockingly bad the customer LACK of care is?  Richard, Love your Airline, fly with you often, but please SORT OUT YOUR TRAIN, SO CALLED CUSTOMER CARE.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	I just paid £11 for a Stockport to Manchester return...	"I'm not a frequent train user, but today I needed to go to town so I bought a return out of the machine, one ticket came out stating 'return' on it. Since I get the train about once every 5 years I thought this was normal.  On the way back home I wasn't allowed out of the station as the guy said I should have 2 tickets, even though only one came out of the machine. He called me a liar and said my mate probably gave me ""half his ticket""  even though I was alone! (what??) Are these people for real? So I was forced into buying a new £4.00 ticket just to leave. Guy at counter was rude too. Next time I'm just gonna jump over the barrier, mugs."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	First class vastly improved	What a difference a year makes. We travelled first class from Edinburgh to London's King Cross almost exactly a year ago and the service and food were very poor quality. Fast forward a year and it has vastly improved. A new James Martin menu has been introduced and it is so tasty. I got chicken curry on the way down and vegetable tagine on the way back. Both were lovely if a tad small - the muffin was moist and tasty - although on the way back they didn't have the advertised desert. The service was prompt and friendly and not stingy with the booze! Our journey was during the week so no idea if it is the same standard at the weekend.We had been reluctant to get the train after our previous experience but it is definitely going to be our first choice in future. Well done and keep it up Virgin.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4
2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	Excellence in diversity	I traveled last night Manchester to Euston and got caught in the debacle of signal failure at Stafford. We were delayed nearly 2 hours but we were kept informed all through and the train manger could not have been more helpful and professional. Virgini then arranged onward transport via taxi to my final destination because no further trains were available. The easy way it was handled and the clear actions of your train manager, whose name I do not know, will stand you in good stead through adverse times. Credit to you all. Keeping us informed was the key, we all knew what if anything was happening.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	Compassionate and Helpful	I was with my husband recently on a trip to London and he was taken ill during the night. I was anxious to get back home as quickly as possible and on arrival at Euston I was lucky enough to speak to Michael, the Train Manager for the West Coast line to Manchester. He was so helpful and assisted us with our seating and made the journey home more comfortable for my husband. Michael and his female boss are 2 young people who are a credit to Virgintrains and I want to highlight that fact by this review.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	Call centre	So many problems with system with call centres being abroad and frustrating. If virgin doesn't listen to its UK customers we simply won't use them, it's 2016 and they cannot take for granted that it will retain customers just because they have some cheap train fares.Customer service is the make or break of a company especially call centres/ customer service.P.s- I couldn't even make a complaint online as it kept saying my email ad was invalid.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	Rude Staffs	I have been discriminated by a member of staff after asking to have my 16-25 years old discount card renewed. Although I'm a mature student, fallowing the company law, in order to have a discount card the university have to stamp the application form. ( which I had) one of the their member of staff said right on my face that as a mature student she thinks that I should not be allowed any discount card. How dare this women talks to customers like that? If I was applying for the card is because I was entitle to do so! And who is she to tell me otherwise? I used to love virgin company but their lack of politeness and rude staffs are letting the company down. Not acceptable.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-12-08T18:21:39Z	Aftermath Customer Service- Laughable	Recently travelled on a virgin train, unfortunately the train was delayed which meant I would then miss my connection train. I understand that these are unavoidable and you just have to make the best out of a bad situation. The staff on the train were very helpful and could not have done more. They explained to me to get on the next train and pay the difference in fair then attach all my evidence and sent to virgin who would compensate me for me loss. I did this- however the response I received was not what was expected. No apology was ever given and just very generic responses. You feel like the really don't care about you now as they have your money. I received £13 back from them- my next train ticket I ended up paying £40 for and got to my final stop 3 hours later than planned. I understand that delays are unavoidable but the after customer service was embarrassing so for that reason I will no longer be travelling with virgin trains and will be sharing my views with others considering travelling with them	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

I was going to Torquay  from London  to help a mentally severely depressed, llow income friend  DIY his run down house.  I couldn't  travel  in the end and Virgin refused  to refund  even a penny as kindness though tickets were  Jon refundable and they're  the cheapest  I could buy and I'm unemployed.  I write to their MD and Richard Branson.  No responsescat all. I even had problems  with other Virgin branded companies.  Virgin are a severe capitalist money making group  and don't  care about their customers.

2016-11-06T19:48:43Z	A first class service	We joined the train at Edinburgh travelling first class to Kingscross, ( £200 for 3 people cheaper then flying ) every thing about the carriage was first class especially the seats, the train left absolutely on the dot and almost straight away was offered complementary snacks and drinks from some very friendly staff,this service continued through out the journey, I would say that the staff went out of their way to make our journey as pleasant as possible,the ride was very smooth and quiet with the train arriving bang on time at Kingscross. What a excellent service what a excellent experience.A big thank you to all the staff on the 1330 Saturday.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5

Newcastle Upon Tyne Central Station, Virgin staff could'nt have been more helpful to me in my electric wheelchair, Birmingham New Street Station, Virgin staff could'nt have been more helpful. 07/10/2016, leaving Birmingham NEC after the first day of the Star Trek convention, the virgin staff on the platform ignored me, missing two trains the last at 18:29.

2016-11-06T19:48:43Z	First Class mistake!	My first experience of First Class on Virgin from London to Leeds.Not impressed at all!!!! - extremely poor track made for a constant need to hold my glass of water until it was finished to prevent it form tipping over. New trains and new track required, seriously what is the point of comfyish leather seats when the ride quality is 20 years behind that of virtually any European train service. - totally tasteless uninspiring smoked salmon salad with cheaper than cheap bread roll- rude, unenthusiastic staff, poorly dressed!- additional £60 on standard fare for, boring,measly, tasteless food and free wifi- really!- just small details like industrial style food serving trolleys, the type you'd expect to see in a prison!- filthy train exteriors, not surprising really seeing as it's almost certainly 30+ year old rolling stock.- ultra slow intermittent wifi- come on Virgin, surely you of all companies can solve this. Take a trip on the Tokyo subway-never ever lost extreme wifi speeds!!!!- so many things about this journey screamed sub standard and old tech. So many small details lacking, making me doubt whether any transport company in this country will ever provide the prices and super high standards, ingenuity and reasonable pricing of European train services.GB invented the bloody train and we're getting our arses kicked here! In future I'll be sticking to standard class as can't really justify the additional expense for such a low tech, low quality service. Virgin.... Really not good!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-11-06T19:48:43Z	Good service	I travel Newcastle to London fairly frequently using first class,book ahead being flexible it not overly expensive. Yesterday 9pm out of Kings Cross excellent crew on food service! Thank youM Flanagan	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4
2016-11-06T19:48:43Z	Fantastic	I was on the 6:15 from Doncaster to Darlington Friday the 7th to see why girlfriend and there was a hen party sat in front of me and the ticket conductor was amazing for 6:15 he was bright and cheerful! And then he took the time and effort to congratulate the bride to be and even bought them a bottle of prosecco it's only a little thing but it really was refreshing to see such a happy gentleman unfortunately I didn't catch his name but a credit to your company none the less!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2016-11-06T19:48:43Z	Website is awful, gave me different seats to ones I've booked	Just made a booking through Virgin trains website and selected my allocated seats, seats we're selected fine but when it came to confirming my order I have been given a totally different seats to ones I've requested, I paid a lot of money for these as their first class and for my partners birthday, after ringing Virgin a number of times and emailing them they said they may be able to change them within 2 working days but cannot guarantee those seats, terrible service!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-11-06T19:48:43Z	Terrible	Booked day return to Edinburgh coming back on the 22.27 on 1.10.16. from platform 8 Waverley Station,  Train was delayed and every time details were shown on the board it just got later and later finally coming in to platform 2 after 11.p.m,  As there was a delay of over 30 mins I was told could claim a refund - this refund would amount to £2.90! however as the website won't accept the details refund is nothing at all.  I guess they hope it's not worth the bother.  Terrible service both re the journey and their refunds policy.  Will avoid Virgin Trains in the future	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-11-06T19:48:43Z	Bad experience, steer clear.	Complete waste of time and money. We sat down at the cleanest looking table, none had been wiped or cleaned. The Gentleman (or not) serving us in a carriage (Which was empty save for being occupied by my husband and I) threw us a sandwich (only ham and egg to offer) and threw down the napkins. Brushed past us again only to sit himself down behind us eating his lunch for the duration of the journey. Disgusted and feel ill treated considering we have paid double to upgrade...	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2016-11-06T19:48:43Z	No luggage space	Busy train from Crewe to London.Staff member refused to help me find somewhere to put my luggage ' Not my responsibility.' Train manager later said it was not the responsibility of Virgin to provide luggage space for passengers:' We don't build the trains.' Do Virgin staff take course in unhelpfulness? Is it surprising that the majority of the population want trains renationalised?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-11-06T19:48:43Z	Train is fine, paid wifi is a joke	The paid wifi constantly logs itself out, is incredibly slow and has no option for a refund. I wasted 5 quid on it and no one should as it was horrible and slow	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	3
2016-11-06T19:48:43Z	Look up customer service!	"Yet again, I have to complain about Virgin Trains. I booked seats.to London from Newark for Sunday afternoon.  Got on the trsin to find it full to capacity with every lobby full of unhappy passengers. This has happened 8 out of my last 10 trips. Sadly as virgin are the only operators on my route I have no choice but when you complain they do nothing."" speak to the guard' was suggested but as the guard was obviously hiding from all the unhappy customers this was never going to happen. Virgin have gone from bad to worse and should lose their routes to a company who is capable of running a train service. Spent the whole journey crammed in by the toilet with about a dozen other passengers. Perhaps you should introduce a standing ticket rather than ripping us off."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-11-06T19:48:43Z	Virgin Trains down the pan!	I'm travelling so called first class from Preston to London. What a joke! The seats are hard and uncomfortable. They resemble second class seats in British Rail days but are not as comfortable. No proper breakfast just a bun, watery coffee in a plastic cup and a piece of fruit! WowI I paid £40 extra for this! My advice is to save money and book standard class in future. Virgin certainly need to buck their ideas up. Some proper competition on this route is badly needed.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-09-16T19:17:27Z	Always friendly...	Use Virgin often as back and forth to Manchester.  Ok not the cheapest way sometimes but always friendly and on time!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2016-09-16T19:17:27Z	East coast: old trains tatty, new ones pretty nice, staff not particularly customer centric	"I've done 4 trips this year: London-York and London-Edinburgh, all 1st class advance booking.The good:========Extreme advance booking leads to good prices, to the point where 1st class is a perfectly sound option.The new Mallard class trains are pretty nice. All trains have passable WIFI and 13A under table power in 1st.Virgin's website is easy to use to book and compare prices.The bad:=======The old HSTs are getting rather tatty.On board customer service is declining. There's usually one really helpful catering assistant, and the rest are bordering on surly.Complimentary food is pretty nice *when you can get it* - hot food was cancelled on one journey due to ""a faulty boiler"" and was not available on another due to being the weekend. What's special about a weekend on the railways?I do applaud having an allergen guide on the web though.The other is that complimentary drinks are not available at the weekend in 1st. Again - why? And this is not made clear on the website, otherwise I'd have bought my own rather than paying inflated buffet car prices."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	3
2016-09-16T19:17:27Z	Very bad customer service	e-tickets are non refundable and you can't change the date and time of this ticket either, had to spend more money. Ended up spending £81 in total and only going to take 1 journey. If I had a choice I would not travel via Virgin Trains but no other choice. Train smells and people make noises in the quiet section also kids are often in the quiet section screaming.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-09-16T19:17:27Z	Prices For Greed	Travel by rail is too expensive, especially with Virgin Trains where there aren't any special offers. I would rather take a train than drive but due to greedy prices I drive as I am not going to be ripped off.There are no offers a month in advance for the journey I intend making so I am not travelling by train for these greedy prices as going to London (over twice as far) is only a few pounds more. That might be an offer but I don't want to go to London.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	3
2016-09-16T19:17:27Z	Gone Downhill	I have used Virgin trains for years regularly between Liverpool and London and there has been a noticeable decline in standards. The tables are often dirty, the seats covered in bits of food and the smell from the toilets just awful. The food in first class has gone from being perfectly acceptable to poor. Breakfast service at the weekend - tea in a polystyrene cup,  a banana and panettone in a plastic packet. First class? I don't think so. Having the monopoly on the route has made them complacent and they are giving customers less and less but charging them more. I wish there was an alternative because I would switch.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-09-16T19:17:27Z	Edinburgh to Kings Cross 9th September	9th September 9.30 am Edinburgh to Kings Cross arriving 13.49 ( or so I thought ) Train broke down twice before we even got to Newcastle adding 30 mins each time. Then got to Doncaster where we were told the train would now be making 5 extra stops. It was supposed to be 3. These extra stops would now make us three and a half hours late. We are all being told we will get our money back, big deal why is it crap service companies think they can solve their serious management failings by giving money back? What about your customers time, frustration , events and meetings missed , how do you value that ? I will never under any circumstances ever use Virgin trains again. This journey had been an abject lesson in truly awful management , yes you see it's the managers who are always trying to save their own skin by using the companies money to bail them out when they screw up. Someone at Virgin Trains put a defective engine on the tracks, they didn't inform passengers when they got on in Edinburgh that there were already delays taking place south of Doncaster which they could have done because they knew and then someone decided to send the same train with the defective engine around 5 more stops. If that's not worth if a disciplinary hearing then I don't know what is. You will never sort out these issues while your management team are hiding, never facing customers and never taking responsibility. The shocking way you leave your front line train staff to carry the can is something Virgin management should be ashamed off No wonder the rail workers are always going on strike.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-09-16T19:17:27Z	so unorganised	train from york to london has been all cancelled and after faffing around, one of the member of staff told me to go to this platform and the train will head straight to london king's cross. turns out it was heading to thirsk and i had to take the train from there back to york to get another train to london again. absolute nightmare.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-09-16T19:17:27Z	Fantastic	Again, i seem to be running against the tide here when I compliment Virgin Trains (West Coast). I regularly catch the train from Stafford to Euston and have enjoyed superb service and punctuality. The booking and seat allocation are always easy to do via the web and picking up the tickets at the station before you travel is simplicity itself. Well done Virgin Trains	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2016-09-16T19:17:27Z	Motion Sickness and Bad Smell = Actual Sickness	During my journey I observed many  passengers in carriage A (at the back of the train) feeling queasy. This was made worse with bad smell all throughout the journey from the toilet at the front of the carriage. Due to the tilting of the Pendolino train sewage leaks across the floor as it speeds around bends.Probably the worst train journey I have ever experienced!Avoid if you can.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-09-16T19:17:27Z	Refund for late train	We buy four tickets from London euston to Edinburgh Weaverly on 29 July 16. The train get delay when it's spioilt after an hour run. On their website they clearly state that they will refund if the train is late for half an hour , even when we board the train, the caption announce there will be refund. We wait for the refund to be back to my sis account. No news ! Make a complaint online, no reply. Call them and it take forever for them to take the call. Finally when they take the call said the case not open yet. And we wrote email again. 2 weeks later, call again to check the status said it takes 2 weeks to process the claim. Well, we call them only after two weeks and still the same answer. Call them today and get the reply that we should write email to another email address. For one month, no action was taken! If you don't want to refund why on earth would you guarantee it online. Feel like getting cheated. Really have a bad feeling about this virgin train.Because of the late train, we miss our tour and all the attraction are closed.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

Got booking confirmation all seemed good. 3 days before due to travel still no tickets, so rang to enquire. After talking to 5 or 6 different CSA, non seemed to know where my tickets were, I didn't have a booking or I was phoning the wrong company?! Promises to ring me back never came to fruition and I eventually booked again. Same seats cheaper price. To turn up at the station to find train cancelled and next delayed. So couldn't have the seats I booked and was late.Fantastic start to our holiday with a three year old! Disgusting and I will never use again. 6 hours of phone calls, 2 days of panic in case we couldn't met our flight and miserable experience. No apologies or recompense for the huge telephone bill I will receive and took 3 weeks to return my nectar voucher, which will be promptly returned to nectar.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

Doors very hard to open as automatic broken.

Every train is dirty - dirty carpets, filthy tray tables and the toilets stink. I got on one yesterday and the smell in the corridor where the loo was smelt awful. A mixture of poo and old hoover bag!I dont know why their toilets smell so bad because TPE and London Midland toilets dont smell. Having walking up and down with a bin bag collecting rubbish isnt enough. The carriages need  a proper clean and freshen up.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	3

Web support confirmed validity and told me to book and claim refund.  I went ahead on this basis this but now Virgin refuse to make the refund.Tried to call and email to resolve - got no where, absolute nightmareDon't try and book by phone or reserve a bike either - call centre hellI'll drive next time	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2016-09-16T19:17:27Z	Cynical marketing disguising price rises	As a frequent customer I can confirm that Virgin may have kept EastCoast's actual 'prices', but the number of lower-price tickets available has been reduced considerably. This train company is an absolute rip off. The toilets consistently either stink of excrement and urine and/or frequently lack soap. Totally unacceptable service, especially for such high prices.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

By the time I looked up we were slowly leaving the Crewe platform so that's when I knew I missed my station as the next station was London! So I went and spoke to the train manager and he was so helpful towards directions and which platform to go to get the next train!

2016-08-09T19:42:54Z	Only good customer service earnt this 2 star otherwise it would have been 0	Travelling with 4 adults and 7children from London Euston to Birmingham.Reserved tickets in advance.Outward journey-reservation system not working so people already sitting in our seats.Return journey-told by guard our reservation no longer applicable as the train had been changed and our carriage no longer existed. Busy train, can't sit kids on their own-very stressful.Faroque the Virgin employee went out of his way to locate a carriage with some seats spare, and asked already seated passengers if they could move. We were lucky that all those involved did not hesitate. It made what should have been a relaxing journey extremely stressful.Big thank you to Staff Faroque, but shame on you Virgin Trains for such a bad experience.I did email Virgin Customer services but am still waiting for a response.  They obviously don't care one bit about their customers	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2016-08-09T19:42:54Z	Smelly carpets and seats and unheigenic toilet area, Very Polite Staff!	We boarded the train and if only they would re-upholster (or dry/steam clean) the seats and replace the smelly carpets with a clean surface flooring like a laminate, the experience could be much better. It is not hygneinic to have a carpet in an area which is so frequently walked upon and would be impossible to clean. The Toilet could be better DESIGNED and not look and smell so dirty. They could have odor or spray bottles on a timer. I still feel sick two hours after my journey. All The staff were very friendly, efficient and polite but the snacks and the drinks like tea and coffee could be improved upon without spending much and these small things could make the experience perfect. The journey was fast and the speed was impressive. layout ad size of seats is also fine. Not a pleasant experience as my seat was smelling of Fart (obviously so many asses have sat and farted on this seat and it has not been cleaned). I had to close my nose and breathe through my mouth the entire journey.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	3
2016-08-09T19:42:54Z	Rip off prices	The price we pay for tickets are not worth it. The toilets are dirty and the toilet floor is often wet. Even when you reserve seats someone else is the seat you or Virgin have double that seat. it's pathetic. Where on earth do this company get away with daylight robbery e.g up to £500 for a journey. No one would ever pay that much for a ticket and that's not even 1st class. The fact is the government should never of privatised British Rail. it was fine as british Rail.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

So now us and my 4 year old are sitting in between carriages for a 3 hour journey and the staff are no help atall.

2016-08-09T19:42:54Z	Mistakenly got stuck on the train	I would like to say how calm and helpfull the staff are on virgin trains. My friends came to stoke for the day and was returning back to London on the same day. To help one of my friend and her child i jumped on to the fast London train with them to put their suitcase in a safe place. By the time i placed the suitcase the doors shut and the train moved! I was in such a state and had mixed feelings and anger everywhere! The train manger came and calmed me down by informing and printing me a ticket instantly to return back to stoke from the next stop ( which was Milten Kynes and takes one hour to stoke!) He informed the driver of the train i was supposed to catch back to stoke and gave me suggestions and was very kind. He was very helpful and i am so grateful of him!

On board I went to seek the food and beverage cart to be met by a member of staff called ""Jon"" (10:04am to Bournemouth) who was extremely rude and nasty who laughed when I said I had a quench of thirst. He wouldn't serve me dispite his cart was full. He would only serve me in the aisle, this I don't mind but when I explained the train is packed and he would be a while he said ""well well well either move or simply wait"" move yes but on a packed train? Simply wait yes but am I not entitled to purchase a drink as a paying customer (£126:00). As I said I had already been to the other cart at the other side of train and it wasn't open his response was ""get over it"" Iam disgusted at this poor attitude! I will be taking this matter further due to the derogatory comments he also spoke but I didn't want to post on public as children read.

Two buses with absolutely charming drivers got us there with 10 minutes to spare. Virgin trains charged us £178 for 2 adult and 1 child singles back to London, and we had a railcard!The toilets were out of order on the train. And customer complaints respond along the lines of: ""we are sorry your evidently ridiculous expectations were not met. Have a nice day.""These days, it really takes some doing to stand out from other companies offering abysmal service, but rest assured: Virgin leads the way. Heaven help their customers if they ever get into space.........  ...although I suspect limitless reserves of incompetance will prevent that from happening."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-08-09T19:42:54Z	Standing room only for hours	When we boarded the train in Prestatyn on a Monday during a bank holiday the train was already overcrowded--at least in second class. A woman standing in the corridor by the toilet -- she was with her two adult kids, who were sitting on the floor, and small grandchild in a stroller shoved up against the exit door -- said the overcrowding isn't unusual on Virgin trains, and that the first-class section had plenty of seats available but the authorities won't let second-class passengers move up there even when the situation was this bad and dangerous - people and their belongings jammed in to fill ALL the floor space, including by the toilets, to the point it was impossible to walk through. The class system has yet to take its final gasp in Britain (no, I'm not from the UK). Knowing it was a holiday weekend, Virgin should've planned ahead better.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-08-09T19:42:54Z	Terrible service, and they ignore consumer rights. Completely unacceptable	I reserved a seat in the quiet coach with a table and next to a power socket as I had a lot of urgent work to be getting on with.  The air conditioning in the quiet coach was broken.  After 2 minutes in the coach I was unable to take the heat any longer (the coach had evidently been sitting in the sun for quite a while it must have been a good 35+ degrees).  Therefore I had to move to another coach, which was noisy, with no power socket or table.  I asked for a refund as I did not obtain what I paid for.  After over 8weeks I received a train voucher, which did not even cover the cost of my original ticket.  Obviously they do this because it is cheaper for them, but as consumers we have the right to obtain a full refund if we buy something which is not fit for purpose.  It's not as if it was a 15minute journey!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

On each leg there are very few unreserved seats in First Class and these go very quickly.  Tonight I am standing between the carriages in First Class (it is the same experience as doing the same in standard class !) and feel completely ripped off.  I have asked Virgin to swap my ticket for a standard class season ticket with a refund of the excess that I paid  but do not hold out much hope.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2016-08-09T19:42:54Z	Poor service	I bought tickets on line. Went and collected tickets from fast tickets. 5 coupons  to come out. Didn't have the ticket. Not knowing the problem, went for the train and wasn't allowed to board. Came back to the ticket booth and  all of them unanimously said it is well known.Called customer service. Won't accept. Blamed the fast ticket machine. I told him that it did say 5 coupons but correct ticket hasn't come out though confirmation email details r correct( (no other option as lI wanted to reach Liverpool on time.).  Had to buy new tickets again, paying double the price !MESSAGE : BUY TICKET AT TRAIN STATION RATHER THAN ON LINE. Virgin may refund but doesn't understand the stress u have to go through.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-08-09T19:42:54Z	Seat Reservation not honoured and customer service dreadful!	Coach in which I had a reserved seat Edinburgh-London was taken off without warning and no alternative seating provided.  Train was full so had to stand the whole way.  Wrote to complain - first reply was stock answer about delayed trains which obviously irrelevant to the complaint.  When wrote back to point this out and reiterate the actual complaint took them 10 days and then replied to tell me they needed a different reference number from the one supplied to identify the booking.  Sent immediately and phoned to check it was OK this time.  Now told it will be another 10 days before they will review the complaint again.  This is simply not how customer service should work!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-08-09T19:42:54Z	great service	My friends and I use the trains regularly going to Blackpool we have started using assisted  travel whitch is fantastic, if u r having a bit trouble with walking ect or with your case's it really helps a lot, the staff especially in Glasgow Central are all lovely and very helpfull my friends and I all appreciate all your help. Thank you.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4
2016-08-09T19:42:54Z	Not professional service you would expect	Reservation system on train not working and toilet on my carriage not working. You wouldn't mind so much if you was not paying stupid prices for tickets but you are so expect the service to go with it.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2016-08-09T19:42:54Z	Disgusting train, overpacked and delayed	Got the train from Glasgow to Preston and it was delayed by over 2 hours, not the trains fault but got moved onto another train that already looked too full. I had paid extra money for our seat at a table and forward facing as I don't travel well and wanted good seats and ended up having to stand at a door for about 1.5 hours of that journey with 2 suitcases and hand luggage as no space anywhere. Then missed my connecting train to Manchester airport and got forced to buy another ticket to get another train as they wouldn't let me use my original ticket for the earlier train. So not a good start to my holiday. The train back took the biscuit though. Waited 10 minutes at the train station for the late train to show up. When it did, the speaker clearly said, this train is full, if you have not reserved a seat then please leave the train as there is no space. I had booked my 2 seats for me and my partner so eventually found somewhere to put our cases(left at doors as no luggage space) and found our seats. Had people standing leaning over me till the first stop as they had got on the train anyway without a seat. Then I went to go to the toilet and get a drink 2 coaches away. The toilet in our carriage was broken as was the next one. Finally found a working toilet and I can't even begin to explain how disgusted I was at this toilet. Poo all over the walls and down the back of the toilet and right next to the flusher. It had the most foul smell I've ever smelled in my life and it made me physically boke that I held in my pee for over 3 hours. Then i attempted to go to get a drink from the next carriage down, had to physically climb over people sitting on the floor and standing and blocking the whole part at the doors and between carriages. Which took me over 20 minutes to get down to the next carriage and back to my seat. Was a joke. I'm not a snobby traveller but when you spend over £150 on train tickets I expect to be able to go to the toilet and at least be able to walk down to the next carriage to get a drink. It was a joke especially after a 9 hour flight. I also ended up having to sit backwards the whole train journey even though I paid for forward facing seats so that just ruined the whole train journey for me.Highly doubt I will ever be using virgin trains again unless I'm desperate. Was genuinely so disappointed.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Deliver what people pay for!	Took a train from Glasgow to Preston.  I was surprised to discover that unlike on ScotRail trains, wifi is not free. Purchased a £10 flexible wifi access code and then used most of it trying to connect to a service that dropped repeatedly and was unbelievably slow.  If you are going to charge people for wifi access then you must provide a reasonable level of service!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Not value for money for First Class service	Train booked from B'ham International for 8.00am as we were early we thought we'd go into the First Class lounge but found it to be closed and once on our journey were offered just parties, one piece of fruit and a drink and on way back just offered a light snack of cheese and crackers and then kicked out of the First Class Lounge at 8.00pm from Euston even though our return journey wasn't until 8.30pm, you'd expect a lot more for a First Class service even if it was over a weekend...	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	3
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Cattle class	Am not normally the sort of person that writes a review but having had so many bad experiences on Virgin east coast trains it seemed reasonable to do so. Every single train journey I have had the misfortune to endure has either been delayed by such a considerable amount that it has been valid for a refund or some kind of transport alternative or it's been so full that even standing has been impossible in standard(cattle) class. To add insult to injury, the staff are often very rude and unreasonable. Today, I saw a pregnant lady turned away from sitting in first class because she'd booked a standard class ticket. Fair enough, maybe but not when standard class is so full that she couldn't even get through to the seat she'd booked. Having experienced this journey with so many different train operators I feel Virgin east coast has brought any journey north of London to an all time low	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Couldn't have done more for us	During recent trip to Edinburgh train could only run to Preston but Virgin did what they could to get us to our destination. We were several hours late but they refunded all our fare very quickly. I dont think they could have done more. Thanks Virgin.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Overpriced for Overcrowded service	"200 pounds a week for overcrowded journeys from Peterborough to London. Most times can't get a seat, trains are dirty, constantly late and of course, there is always a very diligent guard ready to charge you if you don't have the right ticket. Never happened to me, but I wonder why Virgin can't be financially punished by constantly delivering a bad service. They offer peanuts compensation for cancellations, and even so, they always try to deliberately delay ""on time"" services, so delayed trains can go ahead to reduce their delays, before they get caught in the compensation threshold.Certainly the government plays its part on this, as Peterborough also has a ""slow"" service to London operated by Great Northern. The slow service usually takes 30min longer than Virgin, just because the trains have to stop for ages in the middle of the track between Pbo and Huntingdon, just so the old Virgin trains can be classified as ""fast services"" and have a justification for their overpriced tickets."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Mess up with their central computer system cost me money	*Updated*Virgin Trains East Coast Customer Relations compensated me with a rail voucher for £17.60 for the cost difference, after a few email exchanges. Thank youMessage sent to Virgin Trains East Coast Customer Relations:Hello. I went into the *** train station ticket office to purchase 16 individual train tickets from *** to ***, including the return tickets. They were supposed to be £9.30 each, but the station computers apparently had no records of these tickets being available yet. As you can imagine, I was most annoyed. I went home and found them available on the National Rail and the Transpennine Express website the same day, but now only available from £10.40 per ticket. I begrudgingly paid this, so as to secure my tickets. Unbelievably, they are now available for £9.30 per ticket again today! I am extremely annoyed that a computer system issue at *** station and online has cost me £17.60 (the difference in price between the 16 tickets) and I wished to be compensated accordingly. I also wish to make a complaint about this, because it is not the first time that this has happened, and I hate getting ripped off by a faulty computer system. Please respond with a non-automated message accordingly. RegardsThe response was a mostly copy and pasted message, but not automated. However, they skirted over the issue and did not compensate me in any way, when they know full well they should have for their problem. Not impressed...	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Great trains!	I love Virgin Trains, I always pay extra to travel with them to London as I know I am getting better value for my money than with a competitor on the same route (London Midland). Trains may leave late on occasion but the time of arrival is always on time. Comfy seats, spacious surroundings, great cafe and friendly staff! Also, the website has no booking fees which draws me to book train journeys that aren't operated by VT with them as I don't want to pay £1.50 or whatever for a booking fee!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Travelled in style	Excellent service, food and wine with friendly staff. Particularly liked the guards sense of humour on the return 11.11 Doncaster to Edinburgh service today, who made us chuckle with his dry wit and funny stories. Made the journey! Comfy seats and plenty of leg room. Just an all round first class service in first class. We will be back 😀👍	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Liverpool to London train manager	The Liverpool to London train has a particularly friendly, welcoming, informative, pleasant train manager/ticket collector.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	GUTTED WITH YOUR SERVICE	GUTTED WITH YOUR SERVICE: After living in Australia for 12 years and being an avid supporter of all things Virgin to the point of being a Credit Card Holder and Platinum member. It disappoints me that the same service i received in Australia with Virgin is not available here in the UK. I have been back in the UK for 9 weeks and i have booked a ticket to travel to London for a wedding. Now as life has been hectic to say the least i realised i booked the wrong date for my return journey. HONEST Mistake on my behalf. So I call the service line to change my train date and was happy to pay an admin fee for the change as i made the mistake. I was informed quite quickly that you are unable to change the time and will have to buy a new full ticket and forfeit the full price i have already paid!! This is nor fair or reasonable in anyway. Whilst writing this i have been waiting for hold for a manager to be called for me to speak too. VIRGIN get a grip!! You have always prided yourself on being a business where the customer is treated fairly. I am disappointed and this has tarnished the reputation Branson has worked hard to put in place. Disappointed and feel cheated and robbed. At least Turpin wore a mask!! Shame on you Virgin!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Still waiting for a refund six weeks later...	Had a disastrous train journey on 9 March from Crewe to London - signal failure turned a 90 minute journey into 4 hours-plus. I duly lodged my claim for a refund of the ticket. That was in early March, still waiting in mid-April. They've been in touch by email to ask for details I put in the original claim, but I sent them again by return. Then they wrote to me asking me to provide exactly the same info, so I sent it again. No acknowledgement, still waiting for my money back. Very poor service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Simply the best 😀	Thanks to the wonderful staff who helped process a refund of non refundable tickets in light of exceptional circumstances causing my elderly grandmother to cancel her journey. I appreciate all your help, thanks once again!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Terrible	Since Virgin took over the east coast contract they have managed to turn a barely excepable service into a terrible one.The amount of delays and cancellations are unreal.On a recent trip to London both the journey out and the return were chaotic. The train was severely overcrowded, no space for all the bags on the racks or luggage areas. The aisles were rammed with luggage and people. It must have broken more health and safety laws than I'd dare to think about. If there was an emergency on those trains I'm terrified to think what would have happened.Virgin provide a third world experience at first world prices.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Drinking & British trains	Dear Virgin Trains, please add an allocated carriage for those people who wish to drink alcohol while traveling on your trains. This would make the journey for the rest of the passengers so much more pleasurable. It is a frequent occurrence of having to put up with a group of lads popping their cans open and yapping away loudly while the rest of the carriage having to grin and bear it. I am going to fly next time I need to travel from Glasgow to London as I am that fed up with having to put up with drinking on trains. Yours Truly, a Peace-Seeking Passenger	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Mixed Bag	The trains are usually acceptably clean and the staff on board are quite friendly. Falls to pieces at busy times though. If you plan to travel at a busy times reserve a seat or failing that pack a deck chair.Recently I have made a claim on their delay repay scheme. It's a great scheme where if the train is delayed by a certain length of time you get some or all of your money back. Even if the delay was not the fault of virgin. Trouble is be prepared to wait at least 5 months for your money. Currently, I am still waiting.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	3
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Simply awful	What kind of company demands extortionate fares, is continuously late and then when they don't respond to emails and delay repay for weeks they blame the fact that they can't cope with the amount of complaints!Stop being so terrible and you will see customer complaints reduce!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Don't bother with First Class	Paid the upgrade to First Class. seriously don't bother. Hoping for a glass of wine and something tasty to eat... A small diet Pepsi and four crackers and cream cheese. No wifi and no free water. Complete rip off!! Asked the attendant why its not available and her reply complete with a shrug if the shoulders was 'because its so cheap'.  Would have been better to go to thr Sainsburys local in Euston and buy £30 worth of food than wasting it with Virgin.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	will not be travelling again!	I got a train headed to Peterborough from London, the conductor came up to the bathroom banging on the door when I was in there for less than a minute claiming I was taking too long, I had explained to her I missed my train by a few minutes so came into this one and was told it would be okay for me to travel by a staff member at kings cross, she demanded I pay £33.20 on the spot for a ticket even though I showed her my reservation for the tickets online. with less than 20 minutes left of my journey, due to having severe anxiety people began to stare at me so I couldn't say anything and willingly paid the money. for a one hour journey in a cramped carriage with rude staff is something I will not be paying £60 for, Virgin trains you are an awful company and I will not be travelling with you again!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	A con	Charge you through the teeth to change tickets. I didn't realise my name would be on the ticket (or that I would be the one who had to be on the train in the first place), paid to buy my friend a ticket and then found out that it wouldn't count. Why not? How can that not be a thing? Why was it not mentioned my name would be printed on the ticket? I've taken loads of trains and that's never been an issue. And so unbelievably overpriced.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-06-02T06:49:10Z	Terrible experience	I decided to write a review after reading a report in regards to pregnant woman being charged for first class ticket whilst standing in the corridor. Complete disgrace. Simular situation happend to my niece. Train was full. People were standing in the vestibule areas and even in the toilet. My niece stopped in the area between two carriages and was told to make her way into standard class or pay for first class ticket. Conductor only walked from carriage k to carriage j and stopped all journey in the first class so how on earth he would know what's happening in the standard class. Shocking laziness and poor customer service. I only gave one star as there is nothing lower available.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	abandoned	I booked a seat in the quiet coach. Horribly drunk  foul mouthed , abusive football supporters got on at kings cross and stayed on till Leeds - ticket inspector walked through several times very quickly, didn't check any tickets. They should have been thrown off.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	Not even worth 1 star	I will never be using Virgin Trains again, most hopeless company I have ever dealt with. Spent endless amounts of time and money attempting to buy tickets with being sent to every department possible apart from the right one. on-line system wouldn't work and all staff on the phone were rude and even got hung up on trying to buy a ticket. Don't waste your time with them.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	Rude conduct is common	I tend to find that staff on Virgin trains are rude towards passengers waiting in the hallways of first class carriages. They are also very judgmental at classifying people without even asking for their tickets. So, if you don't look like an MP or a businessman then I am afraid you are out. I feel sorry for the lady with a pushchair as she clearly was a victim of the situation. My wife and I travelled on Virgin train to Coventry and both of us agreed that people were treated like animals. Train manager was heard shouting and was generally rude to passengers. On another journey we don't even see the Train Manager at all. Catering staff advised us that he was sitting in the first class carriage himself.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	Bad customer service	After reading previous comment I cannot agree more with what's being said. Train manager on the 10:50am service from Birmingham was a disgrace. All they think about is revenue. There is no customer service. I had a similar experience about a month ago when platform staff refused to help my heavily pregnant daughter at Birmingham New Street claiming she needed to book assistance in advance. Rubbish service! I am amazed people still can afford to go on their trains. The price of the season ticket equals my mortgage repayments for a year.I hope more people complain to independent web sites like this.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	Worst experience	On the 12.03.2016 at 10:50 train from Birmingham to Euston was delayed by about 9 minutes due to five members of staff forcing a pregnant woman with a pushchair off the first class vestibule area. Apparently woman was not allowed to stay there without having a first class ticket. Witnessed everything whilst standing next to the toilets in the first class carriage and holding a standard class ticket! Nobody asked me for a ticket. Confused. Their ticket inspection is rather very random or woman was deliberately targeted. I urge Virgin trains to have more standard class carriages and stop treating people with standard class tickets like second class citizens.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	The worst customer service I have ever encountered..	This company must have the worst customer service I have ever come across. My wife has a medical condition that means she cannot sit with strangers. Virgin chose seats that were not together, and I of course requested a full refund. They then said that a £10 refund fee would be charged unless I produced some form of medical evidence that her condition existed!! All this for £10.  Add to this the fact that a doctor's note would cost the same amount and the cost of a 90 minute phone call and you can see why I think their so called 'customer service' is virtually non-existent.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	Not good for business travel	I have been travelling to and from Crewe to Euston and found I cannot get mobile access to message the office, check platforms for connections etc. This seems to be a train feature (I think metallised windows) and may be to 'encourage' me to use Virgin's pay wifi service. Its an expensive journey this route anyway and if I cannot get any work done I may as well go by car. I will be doing exactly that from next week, or go via Newport on Arriva. Even on that hilly route through Wales I do better.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	2 months on and still waiting for refund	Booked a train at the start of Jan and was charged twice by Virgin Trains website. Complained several times via email but only received automated responses. 2 months later I finally hear from them but only to say that this is a Virgin East Coast issue not a Virgin Trains issue and that I need to contact them directly as it is a separate company. Absolutely appalling customer service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	Trading standards complaint made.	I booked a ticket online ticking the reserve seat option. After payment taken received confirmation but no reserved seats.  Contacted via Facebook who said booking was not available on my selected journey and advised to make a complaint via customer service.  Did so,  did not receive a response. Contacted virgin by Facebook again who said they needed more time to respond. I reminded them my journey was in the morning. Distinct lack of concern or apology in their next reply. A report to trading standards is being made as I was simply mis-sold the ticket and service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	No where near as good as they used to be.	First class travel isn't what it used to be. Despite advertising 'travel like a rock star' you certainly arent treated like one.Only 1 working toilet for 3 carriages of first class passengers and this single toulet was disgusting. It was filthy and stank to high heaven. We had to use the Economy loo's which kind of undermines the c5 times the proce paid for first class tickets.In the 3 hours we were on the train to London Euston we got 1 drink. I asked 2 of the crew for another will a blunt and 'cattle class' response of 'i dont have time'.Then the guy behind us asked another crew member and was served immediately. Maybe I should have stood in the aisle and refused to move until I got another drink.To add insult to injury, I posed my complaints online to Virgin West Coast. I have a screen shot of 'enquiry submitted' but no  acknowledgement at all.Submitted it again almost a week later and so far only an automated response.Shocking Richard Branson!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	Travelling first class and only allowed breakfast if travelling over 70 mins - offered a stale croissant or cold toast instead	Travelling first class 7.08 London Kings Cross to York on Virgin East Coast. Asked for a cook breakfast but told I couldn't have one as getting off at Peterborough (50 mins later) and not enough time to make it. 16 mins after leaving Kings Cross other first class passengers started getting full English. When I asked again I was told I was not eligible as I was travelling less than 70 mins and was given a choice of a stale croissant or cold toast. There were also customers who seemed to know the staff and who got off at Peterborough and were served bacon rolls. Great customer service Virgin - try being flexible with your first class customers. Carriage had the aroma of full English breakfast to add to the torment. I was not even allowed to buy a full English but could have bought a cheese and ham toaster. Customer service response - read the terms and conditions on the menu! Save your money and go second class for short journeys if you are expecting food.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	Awful customer service	I booked a return ticket to Glasgow from derby, got as far as Crewe and everything was cancelled. Spoke to customer services at Crewe was told that I'm entitled to a full refund. Ok I thought great, 123.00 the tickets cost. I contacted the customer service number was given a reference number, sent my tickets back to them recorded delivery. That was over 2 weeks ago and not heard a thing since. Absolutely shocking avoid this money grabbing company they do not care about the customers one little bit.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	Cancellations	Yesterday the 2nd January my Son and his partner were due to catch the 9.15 from Berwick on Tweed to London, this was cancelled so was the 10.15, they eventually caught a train after 11am. Had to sit on the floor until York, This really is appalling service. It has happened so many times since Virgin took over this line. The cost of the tickets have risen considerably but not service. Richard Branson should be ashamed of this line. Instead of being home at lunch time they arrived at 5pm!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	No railcard no travel!	I was travelling from Manchester Piccadilly to London Euston at 10:35, one of 2 journeys on my way to spend New Years in Paris! I was asked to provide my railcard- of which I forgot! Without it I was told I couldn't travel or to pay £70 difference then for the return pay more! I didn't have anything of the kind with me Once I informed the gentleman I was going to Paris for the new year and provided evidence, he basically ran across the station and sorted everything for me! I would just like to thank Oliver who was working the station that morning who sorted everything!! A souvenir is being left at the station for him after my trip! Thank you so much!!

"I was travelling yesterday (28th December 2015) from Peterborough to Edinburgh on a Virgin Train, and upon boarding the train was told by the conductor (over the public intercom) that [electronic] seat reservation systems where not in place due to an unspecified issue at the Kings Cross Terminal (which the train was from).We all grappled for seats as best we could, despite each having reservations.As the train approached York station, the conductor announced that he had been given further information regarding the lack of seat reservations and this was ""due to [water] flooding of the server at York Station"".As someone who works specifically in the database industry, I am deeply concerned by this statement. If this is correct this is a huge oversight and shortcoming by Virgin Trains, not least because data should never be stored on only one server, in one physical location, data backups should be taken several times a day if not more regularly (hourly) and that a company with such a large franchise worth millions of pounds should really have at least one (and hopefully more) database administrator working every day the service is running so that any physical discrepancy can be quickly and smoothly reverted back to the original data. Considering most bookings where made in excess of 24hours before the ""flood"" then even on a worst case scenario of using data 24 hours old,  most reservations should still be valid. On the other hand, the conductor lied to the passengers on the train and reading the Virgin Trains passenger charter I was surprised to find no reference as to what to do in situations when the train company lies/misinforms the passengers on board a train as to the reasons for a lack of expected service.SincerelyMartin Heaps"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	Automatic Compensation for Delays - well, that's the theory!	Having been notified by Virgin Trains of their new automatic compensation repayment system, it didn't take long for one of my journeys to be delayed more than 30 mins. I checked that I had qualified for the auto compensation (advanced payments, booked train, virgin operator) and waited in anticipation....but nothing automatic. After 6 days I ended up entering a manual claim.At least if you are going to introduce these systems Virgin - make sure they work!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2016-03-22T19:47:38Z	First class disappointment	I would like Richard Branson to travel on one of his first class train trips to see just how first class it is Not The toilets are discussing filthy ,  the food limited with no offer of anything hot for breakfast or lunch. How can this service be described  as first class. It's shameful that in the 21st century you can't even get a bacon roll in the morning and something hot for lunch yet be charges extortionate ticket prices . Richard Branson you should be ashamed !!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	Transported!	A brilliant bit of extempore storytelling this morning by the Train Manager on my Virgin Pendolino from London to Manchester – deftly turning a downside into a positive. First the apology – train running slowly as approaching a tunnel where a speed limitation is in operation. Then the mitigation: it should not add too much time to our journey today. And then the added value: because we are going so very slowly we have the rare opportunity to see the fantastic engineering work undertaken by the thousands of navies who hand-excavated the tunnel in the 1830s. And especially to see the two enormous brick-lined air shafts they constructed bringing light into the tunnel and allowing us to marvel at their handiwork.I suddenly saw a distant world of labour, sweat, steam and Victorian can-do.   For me it made the trip!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	Nightmare train journey made better	i travelled from Manchester - London Euston on 29/11/15 departing at 17.35. About 1 hr into the journey we had a message from the train manager explaining that a tree had fallen on the tracks blocking our way and they were currently investigating. Obviously this was annoying for all of us on board and it did cause significant delays to the journey back. Sarah the train manager was excellent at keeping all passengers up to date on what was happening and updating us whenever she could. there is nothing more frustrating that not being told what is going on and this was avoided. luckily they were able to divert the train on a different route. i got home nearly 2 hours later than planned but knew that the train staff did all that they could to make the journey as bareable as possible. After coming into work and praising the staff to all of my colleagues i then received an email saying that i was being automatically refunded for the journey with no forms for me to complete. i was so impressed with this and couldnt imagine this type of service from other train companies.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	Disgusting incompetent staff should be sacked on safety measures	We have just travelled from Edinburgh to Newark Northgate, the train stopped for no more than 20seconds then closed the doors and pulled offWe vacated our seats way before the train pulled into the station but a lot of people were getting off so we had to queueOur two children got off and ran to the guard to say people were still on the train, including us their parents and he ignored them!Our children were cold frightened and distressed as they were stuck in Newark waiting for us to get back as they wouldn't stop the train!!Imcompetent staff who did not follow correct safety procedures should be disciplined for such poor conductThey constantly announce on the train cctv is in operation, so why didn't the incompetent staff check the cctv cameras for the doors before pulling off!!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	The worst company ever! Con and fraud spring to mind and customer disservice is a joke!!!!	Virgin should have their franchise removed they are an unpleasant joke.First train with reserved seat cancelled 10 mins before it was due next train was full with hundreds standing all 1st class also standing!After complaints get travel vouchers then try to use them and cannot book online cannot reserve seats cannot get the cheapest fare!Ring Calcutta/bangalore wherever and they try to put me through to customer services 15 minutes later they say no one answering sorry there is no customer services!!!!!!!!!!!!So I have vouchers that are useless, for a train company that is useless, is the most expensive train company per mile with the most complained about record for time keeping according to the regulator.So this fascist government gives franchises to its rich buddies to run the worst and most expensive train system in Europe and claims privatisation is better that state rail. Boll**** try SCNF or Swiss rail and then tell me private is best and cheapest. Virgin by name rip off by nature. end of ..	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	Worst train trip ever!	My partner and I traveled for his birthday on Virgin from London to York and back.  The trains were late on both journeys -- just as they were dirty.  On the return trip, our carriage simply did not exist.  We had to squeeze between a crowd of passengers fighting for seats.  Extremely disappointing.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	Utterly the worst customer service I've ever encountered	9th November 2015 saw a problem 'on the line', where a delay amounted to 5hrs and a journey in total of 8hrs.Virgin had absolutely no information that was accurate through the whole process. They shoved 3 trains worth of people onto our train while stopped at York (for 3hrs), which was then 'not going all the way to Kings Cross', so they told everyone to get on another train to Leeds, then another train to Kings Cross.The first train at Leeds was cancelled, so everyone - including people simply wanting to use that train from Leeds - was shoved on the following train. This train eventually got into Kings Cross 20minutes later than it was supposed to.I fail to see why they couldn't tell everyone on the train at York that there was a problem, so they could use their ticket to change to Leeds and onto Kings Cross. This could have been done WAY earlier, but they just simply seemed to not know this was possible themselves.Trust the reviews on this site, they're absolutely and utterly incapable of running this service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	Seat Allocations	Since Virgin took over from Eastcoastline I have never, ever been allocated the seats in my preferences, facing forward, a table and a power socket. Last night I booked again and found that the 'change seat' tab wasn't working and therefore couldn't change my seat to one I prefer. I tweeted the help service who said that if I book now and ring customer services in the morning they would change my seat no problem. Okay, so I did that and found that for them to change my seat it would cost £10 for each alteration. I explained that it was Virgin's fault online that I couldn't get the seat I wanted because the website wasn't working properly and was told that the charge would still incur. This is a blatant rip off to allow Virgin to extort more money from customers, the sooner the railways are nationalised again the better.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	Web support is not upto the task.	I recently had reason to call web support to get advice on a ticket query, after thirty plus minutes of holding I gave up and tried again a few hours later, same result, over an hour wasted in two calls and still no answer. It wasn't like this before Virgin took over so what's changed? Get your act together Virgin, just because you have a monopoly doesn't mean you can take the mickey.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	Very happy!	I had a problem with my tickets and called up the day of my journey and the customer service I received was excellent, the man on the phone was very helpful and sorted my issue out straight away! The journey was also great, no problems and free wi-fi on board so can't complain! Thank you Virgin Trains 😊 X	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	Come on it's 2015!, why is the wifi connection like dial up...	Now while the train is warm and comfortable, I get my laptop out ready to make the most out of my 5 hour journey, happy to pay the expensive price for Virgin internet (not really but hey, that's life...) so make my journey seems quick n easy, only to find the connection is like dial up and cuts off every 6-7 minutes, REALLY you are meant to be Virgin!...come on sort your s*** out!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	Ticket price swindle using discount rail card	Virgin increase the unit price of a ticket if you use a railcard to get a discount. You are unable to access the cheapest tickets AND use any type of rail discount card. So, beware . . . Virgin trains greedy and not honest as they do not state that if you use a railcard for a discount they automatically charge you more for the ticket!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	Staff need to learn some respect	"Travelled from Keighley to London Kings Cross at the weekend, which meant changing from a Northern Rail train to Virgin's at Leeds.Unbeknown to me (my tickets were booked more than two months in advance), engineering work on the Airedale meant I had to get the replacement bus service to Leeds, which took so long that I missed the Kings Cross train.Not my fault, but try telling that the jumped little twerp working on Virgin's information desk. Before I'd even finished explaining what had happened, he began shouting at me about it supposedly be my fault that train were not running properly. I tried to reason, which only led to him shouting more and making me have to shout to get a word in edge ways. He kept banging on about ""the website"". Yeah, because of course everyone logs onto a website before they start their journey. And when I looked later, the message about the replacement bus service was in tiny writing that was barely noticeable.Anyway, after wiping the spit from his mouth from my face and telling him that I wasn't prepared to pay another £98 for a new ticket, he begrudgingly stamped the back of my ticket and wrote some scruffy sentences on it to say I could travel on the next train.It could have been left there, but he continued to mouth off saying things like ""next time make sure you're here on time"". Yeah, like I intentionally got on a replacement bus service.I suggested that he ask his superiors about any upcoming customer service courses as his manner was lacking and he threaten then to ""take that ticket back off"" me.I took this has a physical threat and told him to ""sod off"" before walking away to make a complaint at the other information desk on the concourse. A few minutes later, transport police stopped me and said that Virgin Train's rude and aggressive twerp had complained that I had verbally abused him. The cheek of it.Anyway, the police agreed with me that he was out of order and wasted their time (despite them wasting their own by making an unnecessary amount of notes) and I am now waiting back on my formal complaint to Virgin East Coast. Frankly, I feel the guy I dealt with should be fired."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	The staff are always right	"Virgin, like certain airlines, have no interest in the customer. Whatever our complaint, they always seek to justify, never correct.  The booking system, disinterested staff, overcrowded trains (we shared the between- carriage space with 50 Newcastle fans one Sunday, standing from York, elbows wedged to our sides) and anti-customer service are now a complacent norm rather than an unacceptable state of affairs demanding root-and-branch reform. Pre-sale, we have to swallow all that matey bluff and puff: ""It's as easy as ABC"", ""Give us a bell"", ""Business carnet, the ultimate in flexible travel""....  as though we were all born yesterday.The joke is that this schoolboy concept (let's call it ""Virgin"" - snigger, snigger) should have become so respectable that the adults, like Stagecoach, want to be seen to get down with the kids."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	Compensation vouchers a joke	My comment is about using compensation vouchers.  My husband travels to London on the train quite a lot but was delayed in the summer.  He was duly sent £32.50 in vouchers - hardly compensation - more a con to use Virgin again.  Anyway the vouchers cannot be used on online bookings, you have to call a number or go to your nearest staton to book.  Hardly customer friendly.  Fares are more expensive booking this way and you cannot claim Nectar points as you can online - and at £220 thats a few! Then there is a huge palava of writing a letter and sending the vouchers in at least 10 working days before you travel.  They then call you to taken payment balance.  Sorry Virgin - customer service is a joke.  How many people just go 'oh I cant be bothered' and you have paid out no compensation at all!!!!  Thats why you make so much money!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	3
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	disastrous website revamp	The new booking system on the main website is an utter disaster, full of glitches, freezes and general malfunctioning. TERRIBLE. Gave up and went to Red Spotted Hanky.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	Virgin Trains - Beware of making an error when booking online	I purchased a return ticket at 10:47 at 18:00 the same day I realised i had booked the wrong return date. I called customer service to amend the ticket and was informed I would have to buy a new ticket, pay a cancellation fee and then pick up the original return tickets at the self service machine and post them by recorded delivery to an address in Scotland to get a refund, which would take up to 5 - 7 days to complete upon receipt of the tickets. How in this day an age of digital business  can a train service have a policy so inefficient and unhelpful. You mean to tell me they could not have amended my original booking? I had booked the ticket 1 week in advance, the tickets hadn't been issued and I had called in less than 24 hours. The argument used by Customer Service is that it was my fault and this is the policy of the train lines. I for one will not book another online ticket with Virgin Trains and will avoid at all costs travelling on Virgin Trains. Their policies and attitude to customer service is dreadful. Lets see if I actually get back the refund.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	Excellent journeys to and from Edinburgh	I booked in March for a journey in August and decided to go for the first class option - £31 each way with a senior railcard.  We travelled to Edinburgh at 3.30 pm and came back on a 7.30 am train.  The food and drink options were very good with no shortage of things to eat and drink - lots of alcohol available on the evening journey.  The staff were well presented and very competent.  The seats were very comfortable for a long trip.  All in all there were no complaints and I would most certainly use this service again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	Unbelievably bad customer service	Booking made a month prior to travel, sent in rail vouchers to pay for part of my journey but these somehow became lost in the post. Called to pay for the rest of my journey, passed to many different departments. Repeatedly told incorrect information. Promised numerous call backs but recieved none. Told that the 'back office' needed to take payment as no other department had the facilities to do this. But I could never seem to get through to them. A day before travel and its still not sorted out, extremely stressful and totally incompetant and unhelpful organisation.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-11-30T23:10:25Z	The worst train rides of my life!	From London to Manchester: The platform is announced 5 minutes before the departure and VirginTrains want to check the tickets of all 300 of us before we can board . A trolley with supplies starts to push everyone so it can load the train on time.The service was clearly overbooked, there were people sitting on the floor, arguing with each other. Couples seated away from each other but still trying to make a conversation. The trains from Virgin don’t have enough toilets and half of them weren’t working. The other half was dirty and disgusting as were the corridors. The seats are also too small, it makes you feel as if you were on a plane. From Manchester to London:On the return part of the journey the train was much less crowded but VirginTrain found a way to rip us off.  Like Ryanair in the past they try to make money out of stupid fees such as for not printing the tickets. It’s 2015, the world has enough waste and most of us have smartphones, I avoid printing everything I can. The tickets have QRCodes on them; there was absolutely no need for it. Their excuse was that they couldn’t read the code from mobile phones, which is a lie, I do it all the time, and it wouldn’t even matter because they not even have qrcode scanners. It took me 15 minutes to have it printed, cost me £5, just so the staff at the platform could underline my coach number. And then they said it was going to a certain charity no one could tell me the name. Truth is they have no control over fake and legitimate tickets but they still try to make sure you pollute the planet a little bit more. I got three sheets of unnecessary printed pages that are going to the garbage straight away. There were about 300 people on the outbound journey, that makes it at least 300 sheets of litter on a single journey. I'll avoid  travelling on VirginTrains from now on their service is so bad that it makes a plane journey seems wonderful. And it's usually cheaper too.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2015-07-27T04:12:52Z	Very expensive and terrible service	I use Virgin trains, West Coast line, every year when visiting UK for work and family visits. In 2014 my experiences were very poor. This year I only needed to take one trip, from Carlisle to London, and was very disappointed to find if anything a deterioration. I booked first class as I normally do, and it was nearly 100 pounds for this three hour trip. It is daylight robbery, really. But if the service had been good I would not have complained. I boarded at about 9.50am and was hoping for some mid-morning coffee and cakes but half an hour or so later, they came round with breakfast (bacon sandwich and fruit).  Why anyone would want breakfast at 10.30 am is beyond me. I asked for a biscuit or something and all they could give me was a croissant. While making a decision about breakfast I asked what time lunch would be. I was told 'after Preston' which told me nothing, really, but seemed odd as the train was due to arrive at Preston at about 11am which was very soon afterwards! (Actually it was about an hour after Preston that lunch came round (what was fine), and I since realised that 'after Preston' meant that there was  a new shift of staff and the current staff could not give a flying fig what happened to customers aftrer they themselves left the train). So when lunch came round I was offered.... bacon sandwich or fruit!! (the same as breakfast). There was also an option of chicken salad ( don't kmow what happens if you are vegetarian). I asked for a bacon sandwich and fruit and was told I couldn't have both; it was either/or. Really! I am not joking! Eventually after some argy-bargy I was allowed both but I was made to feel very unreasonable, that I might be depriving somebody else of their lunch, and that the woman was putting her job on the line by allowing me a 'main course' and 'dessert'. I was also told I did not need it because I had had the opportunity of having breakfast. This was after paying 94 pounds for my ticket! The staff spent most of their time sitting in the front carriage playing with their phones and did not exaclty rush to help an elderly woman getting off with a suitcase. My husband travelled two days later and he was allowed bacon sandwich and fruit for lunch without demur. Maybe that was because he got a train at around 11am and couldn't be accused of turning down breakfast. If I hadn't been right at the front of the train I would have walked down to the buffet to get some proper food. I had been reduced to this on one occasion in 2014.What on earth does Virign think it are playing at? This is so far up the end of the unacceptable scale it isn't funny.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-07-27T04:12:52Z	day light ROBBERS	My grandchild and two of her friends needed to get to London for an England team training camp. Since they where only children, they needed an adult to take them. My granddaughter, is staying with her other grandparents in England, as she lives in Australia, so my son asked if I could take them. No problem, till I chose Virgin Trains and booked an advance ticket. Unfortunately a couple of days  after booking, I found that I  was unable to take them. Two frustrating days followed, left on hold for 30 mins, trying to get through on numerous occasions. At long last, I was through to INDIA! Patronising, and unable to understand my request. A supervisor finally told me in no uncertain terms that having booked an advance ticket, and that as I was the adult, ALL the tickets where in my name. Even though I had found another adult to take my place, I could not change that name. Basically, I was told to rebook with the new adults name, AND REPAY FOR NEW TICKETS. NO REFUND ON THE ORIGINAL. In my book Virgin trains, that is THEFT.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-07-27T04:12:52Z	Not a pushchair / pram friendly train	"No help from customer services to find space for parents that need to use a pram / pushchair for their babies to rest during long journeys. I cannot believe they say pushchair / prams are welcome as long as they kept folded, my issues to this policy are the following:If you travel alone with your baby, who will help you to fold the pram, whilst you hold the baby in your arms? Not that is your false that a parent travels on his/her own, but where is your ""customer service and understanding"" for this type of customer? I completely agree with the priority for wheelchair users at any transport service, but come on, where is your common sense that if there is a free space, no wheelchair user and a baby in need of using a pram, why not making use of it. I use the bus & train services in the city with a pram, if I see a passenger requiring the wheelchair space then I give it to them and use an alternative space of train service.Whilst my baby reach the toddler stage, I don't believe I will use this train company, and I don't think I will use them again, the customer service is poor and not helpful to find solutions, they can say NO to you without offering an alternative."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

I've been a regular commuter between Manchester and London for donkey's years and accept that sometimes things go wrong. However, lack of communication is still a major issue as demonstrated yesterday.Please can someone explain 1. why trains (in this case the 1900 and 1920 hrs) were shown as ""on time"" when shortly before we wold normally board, the trains were cancelled2. Why your staff on the concourse did not know what was going on.  I checked with them and was told that the 1920 was definitely running.The woman on the desk did admit that she hadn't a clue and whilst that is honest , it really does not help."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2

2015-07-27T04:12:52Z	Faceless Virgin!	I tried to book 6 first class return tickets to London for business colleagues this week. The web site was on a go slow and then crashed. I finally managed to get as far as the reservation stage and noticed that the seats allocated were not together. Not a problem, I thought, I book train seats regularly. I clicked on the change seats, noted that there were plenty of 4 seats together and 2 opposite, selected and saved. No matter how many times I did this, the new seat selection would not save. I called customer service and was told that it was probably a fault on the web site. I could either book the seats and then try to change them,( not guaranteed) or just delete and start the booking procedure again. I chose the latter as it was imperative that we sat together to prepare for a meeting.  I tried to re-book immediately but the same journey had increased by  no less than £ 85.10 in the 5 minutes it took to do this!  Obviously I called customer serviced again - they said they couldn't help, no-one in the company could over-ride the web prices!!! I can't believe this is true. Is the company run by machines? I asked to speak to a manager - this was Thursday. I am still waiting for someone to call me back today (Saturday). Nevertheless, we needed to travel to London, I booked the seats, they still didn't allocate together, I tried again to change but the change still not actioned. I booked anyway and then called customer service again - A customer service tele-operator (Joy)  said she would put forward a request but could not guarantee! It would take 72 hours to learn if it was possible!! Is this really a reasonable response! It only took 5 mins to take nearly £600 from my credit card but 72 hours to learn if we can actually sit on the train together, despite viewing many together seats.  Joy did not bring much joy and was quite sharp, pointing out that although I could give feedback it wasn't going to make any difference and there was nothing I could do about anything or speak to anyone else.   I still haven't heard back from anyone! As my colleague said - 'Thank you for choosing to travel with Virgin' but do we indeed have a choice. The customer service I received this week was both frustrating, and in the latter part quite frankly rude!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2015-07-27T04:12:52Z	Cleanliness	I travel on Virgin trains a lot. My company pays thousands. I am really dissapionted that my company pays £181 for a trip to London yet I always find the seats are not clean. Often dust and food left rotting by other customers isn't cleaned up for my journey. I would not pay this much to travel as it's very uncomfortable to sit on a seat that is clearly dirty. I have experienced this many times now. My most frequent route is Birmingham to London.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2015-07-27T04:12:52Z	Disaster! And no customer service!	I traveled with them recently and although I booked well in advance I had to stand all the way from Birmingham to London after a full day at the fair! Just imagine that.It wasn't just standing comfortably, we where hundreds of people standing all along the train cramped one to another, it reminded me of the wagons to Aushwitz!!!I made a complaint and get a couple of vouchers, but they where useless! I traveled again the same route a few weeks after and tried to us them but apparently they will only be valid when buying at the station which is very expensive and you are not guaranteed to have a place which of course I wasn't going to risk, so I called up a number that costs 10p per min! and was told they can't help me!So I emailed them and since resent the email at least 5 times but so far after more then 6 weeks I have not received any response!This is not bad customer service! This is literally no customer service!Beware! People are making millions out of your pocket and giving you no more then aggravation and waste your time!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-07-27T04:12:52Z	Good	I have had a couple of bad journeys from London to Liverpool with Virgin Trains , also with customer assistanceI must say both times their customer service have been very good , I have had no problem with them , they have dealt with it in a very professional and polite way and compensated me to my satisfaction	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4
2015-07-27T04:12:52Z	Awful Customer Service	First I think the trains are pretty good most of the time.  BUT, when you have a poor journey and need to let Customer Service know, they take a long time to reply.  I paid nearly £500 for a first class ticket that was far from first class and the service very poor.  Customer Services tried to fob me off with a £20 voucher!  That wouldn't get me very far.  I wrote to express my disappointment and after sending proof of  the cost of my ticket, they offered me compensation.  A First Class return ticket.  They sent me a code to use, but turns out it was a 'promotional code' which could only be used during certain times  and would expire at the end of May- not much good for me when I am working most of the times it was available.  I contacted them again, was told I could have a new code, which would be valid for 6 months but I would have to wait for the first code to expire.  What a nonsense.  Sadly, a different person dealing with my complaint every time.  Not helpful, not sorry, not bothered about customers.  Shocking.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-07-27T04:12:52Z	Awful	"I am shocked at Virgin Trains the whole experience was awful.The staff at the ticket gate were unfriendly unhelpful and damn right rude. How Virgin Trains can employ people with such disregard to the public and paying customers is beyond me. We travelled to scotland and the staff were rude and abrupt when we left Euston, basically demanding to see the tickets without any customer care or respect, which left my friend who was travelling with me absolutely fuming.On our return I left a present on the train by mistake, I had already exited the platform before I realised when I approached the staff they basically just shrugged there shoulders and told me to go and look, I did and it was not there a man then told me he had handed it to the Virgin Train staff I went back and was told they did not have it and to go to Lost Property, I did this all the time my anxiety rising as it was an expensive present. I was told nothing was there.I returned back to the Virgin Train Staff to be told exact words ""What do you want me to do about it""!!!!!!. I was totally took back by this horrible uncaring attitude. Finally a staff member told me it had been been took to lost property but after I had already enquired the first time no apology or anything.I went back to lost property and it was there I was absolutely disgusted with this treatment.That is just the staff, the trains are terrible I have never sat in such uncomfortable seats and had a backache from start to finish, it was as if I was sitting on cardboard and no matter how I sat I could not get comfortable.On the return trip we had the last people's rubbish still on our seats, we asked about the cleaner to be told some trains don't have a cleaner 😬.I am so surprised Virgin Trains are as bad as this they should be ashamed of what they regard as service I suggest they get there Trains right before they try to send people into space."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-07-27T04:12:52Z	Awful Customer Service	I just booked tickets online and due to an issue with their website it chose the wrong seats and seats not next to each other even though i had clicked the seat finder and saved my chosen seats.  I rang the telephone number on their site to explain what had happened all I got was a very rude man who could hardly understand what I was saying and refused to help, let me speak to a supervisor or give me another number to call!!  I am waiting for feedback from an online complaint so their rating may improve if I get better help but the advisor was awful and so rude.  I am quite annoyed that I never had these issues with east coast before virgin took over but they need a massive improvement in helping their customers!!  All the guy on the phone wanted to do was book me new tickets!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-07-27T04:12:52Z	Really?	"Here I am on the 19.00 train to Manchester, the 27th of February. Ok it is a Friday, it is busy and we know it. The train is a chaotic mess of people sitting on the floor, while the bar conveniently had ""problems"" with the card machines. In fact we read problems as a very well known fault in the train infrastructure that makes credit card payments a pain everyday. So ok, we do not want to have queues of people standing waiting for signal, so we tolerate. Then the train manager starts with the usual litany of scripted apologies and he is so moving when he profers ""I applogise because no one should be sitting on a floor during a travel."" Thanks for beating your chest boy, however your first class is empty and when we booked the ticket no message would tell us that the train was overcrowded and there was no seat available. A word of advice, do not take your Customers for cretins while you play your yeld management the dirty way."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2015-07-27T04:12:52Z	Best customer service	I was at traveling back to Coventry from Wolverhampton station on 11/2/15 at 13:00 and I had just missed my train. A very helpful lady called 'Debbie' made sure I caught the next avalible train, with the right ticket and all with a smile and friendly manner. Thank you Virgin! Your staff are a credit to you.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2015-07-27T04:12:52Z	Fantastic customer service	Virgin trains customer service are amazingI had an issue when me and my family went on our travels (problem has been addressed hence wont go into detail)Had a phone call from a member of the team a couple of weeks later who had investigated the problem, fixed the issue and sent me 4 first class travel tickets with a huge apologyIn my opinion..this is first class serviceThank you	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2015-07-27T04:12:52Z	A disgrace over Christmas...	Get on here Virgin and explain the appalling Christmas service from Glasgow to Liverpool on the 28TH of December.I came home from Glasgow to Liverpool,tickets were bought in October when there was no sign of disruptions.You must have known but we did not.I could not get off at Wigan I had to get off at Warrington bank quay.I was told on the train that I would then have to walk to Warrington Central.I was told this walk was 4 to 5 min OMG it talk me 30 min walking with a big heavy case.Were was our transport to Warrington Central, why was I lied to about how far away it was. I could have got a cab.It is down to you Virgin to get us safely to our destination when we buy our tickets.Then I had to travel to Lime Street Liverpool instead of getting off at broadgreen station costing me another £13 in a cab.You are a disgrace who does not care about there customers.It is your disruption the least you can do is make adequate arrangements to get us to our destination.If you want to dig up railway lines during a christmas period it is down to you to lay on transport to help us..I am 63 but there was a lady of 74 who had to walk that distance too. I am beyond angry with this service and the idiot who suggested digging lines up over a Christmas holiday, barking mad Idea from people who just don't care.Explain yourself Virgin trains	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2015-07-27T04:12:52Z	Absolutely woeful	Where to begin? It's pointless even talking about anything other than the fact the trains are about as unreliable as you could possibly imagine. I have the misfortune of having to travel with Virgin every single week and they're rarely, and I mean rarely on time. Minimum 10 minutes late, with anything up to 3 hours late bolted on.It's irrelevant to talk about their staff, the trains themselves, the catering, the booking process when the trains only roll up half of the time. 3 trains cancelled in the last 6 weeks. 50%. Unbelievable, their incompetence knows no bounds.I only wish for mine, and others sanity that they don't pursue the West coast line contract when it's up as I don't think I could handle it.Update:Yep, Virgin trains haven't gotten any better. Still the absolute pits.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	Good service, but don't travel backwards!	I have a love and hate relationship with Virgin. The staff, website and service are all pretty faultless. The trains on the other hand just make you want to boak - especially if you're facing backward. I'm not one for travel sickness, but their trains shocking. Fix the trains, stop them tilting and you've got it nailed!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	Brilliant service	We were in a party of 6 going to Gretna Green for our wedding.  When the lady who came to look at our tickets saw us she said at the next station take yourselves along to First Class.  We believe she was a manager.  All of the staff on that train were very professional and we had a lovely journey to Gretna Green we were all made to feel very special.  we must admit we always find the Virgin trains very clean and professional staff.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	poor first class service	We travelled to Glasgow on a first class ticket on Thursday the 11 September and the service included sandwiches, coffee,tea and soft and alcoholic drinks. The staff was helpful and friendly. However when we travelled back on the Saturday, as soon as r were on board the service manager said the first class passengers would get a snackbox but any other drinks had to be bought from the restaurant carriage. The snacking contained a measly packet of crisps,  a couple of mini chocolatefingers, a bottle of water with a squash stick, a packet of mini cheddar and box of Tictacs. As we had had no lunch were very disappointed and very hungry. So we ended up spending an extra  £18.00 on food on top of the £96.00 we paid for our tickets to London. Does Virgin think that people don't have to eat at weekends?  It is not mentioned anywhere that there is no food service in the first class at weekends. Not worth the extra money.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	3
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	Not worth the money for First Class!!	I expected more from Virgin travelling in their First Class carriages. I don't usually moan or complain but this I feel I need to. Me and my family purchased 4 First Class tickets to Manchester from London Euston, it took around 2 hours 30 mins and on this journey to Manchester we had a miserable attendant who actually came around with drinks and snacks about 4 times which was well worth the money and the surroundings were pretty much clean and tidy, but on the way home which took longer due to travelling at night, we had an attendant who came around once in 3 hours with awful tea and coffee and a silly little box of snacks which included a small bag of jelly beans.. Not what you want at night time especially for the price we paid for First Class! Not just that, the surroundings were filthy, we we're allocated seats right next to a dirty over flowing bin and our rubbish was left piling up on the table for around 2 hours! I cannot express how bad the toilets are as well, I know that toilets are not a clean place but people who pay a lot of money for first class should have clean toilets to use and shouldn't be able to smell the toilets sitting at their tables! Wifi is also free to First Class passengers.. That's if it works! For the whole journey there and back we were constantly trying to connect to the wifi but it kept cutting off and asking us to reconnect. Overall a very disappointing experience.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	EXCELLENT	I travelled london euston to milton keynes first class, loved every minute, clean trains, spacious, friendly staff. great lounge at euston. Served a tea or coffee on train journey as main service not served until after milton keynes but still for a £48 return ticket, which got me a seat and drink and snack in the lounge, a comfy spacious seat on the train and a hot drink. On the return the same i will be looking to book them as often as possible as i have new work commitments in milton keynes. for the extra i paid i found it completely worth it.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	Rubbish services at a very high price	I'm so disgusted by their refunds process.I bought tickets under booking ref NNRJ2L4C on 12th February. I called 3 times your customer services until I managed to speak with a quite bright person. I asked for the refund for the outward trip to London. I was told that I can cancel that ticket and get a total refund of £35.50 withing the next 4 weeks. And I booked another ticket (much higher price of course). I send the ticket to Edinburgh office on 13th February. Today is 27th of March and I still didn't receive my refund. Today I contacted them again and I was told they never received the tickets. I didn't send them by recorded mail (other money, more fun) and now I can't get a refund.This company is a disgrace. Tickets prices are so high ... customer services phone numbers are charges and at least they can't be professional.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	Excellent updates on delays	I found the service to be very good, we were delayed for over an hour whilst on the train as the train in front had hit something. The updates from the train guard and virgin trains twitter page were updated almost immediate. My only critism is that there could have been a free cup of tea offered as a lot of us had been travelling for hours and were in need of a cuppa by late evening! Overall though I have never had a problem with Virgin.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	Neither here not there….	I am an avid user of virgin trains due to being around 3 hours away from home whilst at university.There are many things that frustrate me about the service.1)When i pay full price for a ticket for my journey home that consists of 2 trains and my ticket doesn't even get checked. This means that there are probably a large amount of people getting the train places for free whilst I'm paying full wack to sit in a seat.2)You are given seat reservations but there is most likely always someone sat in your seat so you don't bother and sit somewhere else and then end up getting moved because you are in someone else's seat.3)When you make the effort to buy a ticket in advance to try and save yourself  a bit of money. There is no way of cancelling it. Even if your not going to use it and just want to cancel it so a seat is free for someone else. You can't do it. Nevermind get some kind of credit to use towards a future ticket.4) Everywhere you go these days they are rewards cards and loyalty cards and occasionally send you offers and discounts…not virgin….i spend a ridiculous amount of money with them and as a loyal customer i feel that you are never rewarded.5) The one time i forget my railcard, bearing mind most of the time my ticket doesn't even get checked, someone asks me for it to which point i explain my problem and even go to the extent of showing them a picture of my rail card, the emails i get from the railcard company and proof of purchase…..they charged me for another full price ticket onto of the one that i had already brought. So much for being a loyal customer. And to follow we had to stand in the isles as the train was so full whilst first class was empty and the conductor tried charging us for standing in the hallway between two carriages. 6) The process for claiming money back for delayed trains is very difficult. They want every little detail down to the very minute of your departure. If my train is late and i miss the purpose of my journey, i have wasted money for nothing.However after my complaining i must note that the trains i use are most of the time warm an comfortable and with exceptions the staff on board are very helpful if you need information. Definitely room for improvement though.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	3
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	No refund, no exchange, no upgrade on tickets available!!!!!	Bought 2 tickets to Liverpool 2nd class, paid £300. Wanted to upgrade to 1st class 1 day later and was told that I need to buy  NEW tickets if I want to travel via First Class. I couldn't exchange or cancel them either. This isn't a customer friendly company at all, I can see now how they make such profits!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	Poor service	I bought a ticket for a journey to Bolton From Brighton. Due to losing one of many pieces of paper (but still having proof of buying the ticket from Th Trainline I was  forced to pay £99 on top of £44 I already paid to travel.I went to the Virgin ticket desk in London Euston and spoke to a (Team Leader and refused to give his name). He refused to refund me or do anything to help. I then tried to get on the 18:40 train but was refused (even though I have two tickets. The train manager (who also wouldn't give her surname) was rude, patronising and unsympathetic in refusing to let me get on the train.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	Virgin Trains kept me safe travelling at night!	Virgin Trains are amazing. I can't imagine travelling North-South with anyone else now. Their carriages are always clean and smart, their shops have lots of choice (I mean, for a train, it's impressive!) and at least there's a real person that talks to you over the tannoy and not a plink-plonk recording!Also need to note one incident at a certain UK station where, travelling back late at night, I was getting heckled by a clearly wasted, burly man in the waiting room who was, of course, drinking in there. I defended myself and walked quickly away from the situation. Luckily, there happened to be a member of Virgin Trains staff on the other platform. I ran over to her and told her what had happened, in case other people would walk into the same trap.I wish I could remember her name but she left her spot (she was waiting for a train home herself!), checked out the situation, assured me it was safe, alerted other staff and even walked back across and waited with me for my train - even though hers was leaving soon after mine!Best customer service EVER.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	Absolutely Awful	£140 for a standard class ticket booked a week in advance from Manchester to London-  train arrived 2 hours late and so i was 2 hours late for my train home - but that pushed me into the 'peak time' for returns, so regardless of the fact that it was their fault i was late they tried to charge me an EXTRA £125 for a new ticket !!!I refused to pay and the train manager threatened to get the police to throw me off the train, i refused and we ended up in a big argument he eventually just ignored me but it was humiliating and very stressful.AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL and  - its double the cost of flying.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	Not as good as it used to be	I travel on Virgin trains from Preston or Manchester to London fairly recently - I got used to traveling first class when work paid I no longer travel on business to London and if I did, they wouldn't pat first class - However, by planning ahead and being flexible on the travel times,  I've found that I can get reasonably priced first class tickets which are better value that driving. If I can't get first class, I don't travel. However, the number of affordable first class tickets does mean that first class has started to get a lot busier and the service can be varied. Usually, the stewards are friendly and helpful but occasionally, there is the odd steward who is not quite up to standardThe only time I've been really disappointed with the service has been when the train was de-classified - I suspect it was the same day that another reviewer was traveling - I was lucky to get my seat but the train was horrendously full with a lot of less than sober football fans who hadn't been able to get on their train to Liverpool - I heard that extra trains where being put on to cope with the situation but it was chaotic at Euston and I suspect there were just a lot of people who jumped on any train heading north - So not really the fault of Virgin trains	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	Generally fine	When nothing goes wrong with the booking, Virgin are excellent. The site is easy to use and there are plenty of different options for the train fare. The staff on board the train are generally very helpful. However - when there is a problem, good luck in getting it sorted. Their customer service line is appalling and unhelpful.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	4
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	Have you travelled first class with Virgin trains recently?	For my 50th birthday I didn't want a party or celebration at home but instead to travel by train to London in first class.  Memories of being a student and sitting on a case in the aisles or in a draughty corridor outside the toilets was to be times long gone.  This is the return leg of the journey.  We did have reserved seats but no means of getting into the correct carriage to get to them.  When we were told to get into this carriage the train manager let my husband and daughter board the train and tried to stop me as he said the train was full. As you can see from the photo this is what it is like nowadays.  The gentleman at the forefront of the picture actually gave up his seat for most of the journey so that I didn't have to sit on the floor.  The 2 others of my family who were with me, including my husband who is still recovering from a stroke last year, had to stay on the floor together with others.  No-one could use the toilets as the nearest one was blocked and as people were either sitting or standing throughout the whole of the train you couldn't access any other toilets either.  No-one could buy  or be served any food or drink.  They even had to stop the train outside Milton Keynes to hook us onto another engine due to the numbers of people in the train, and then we had to travel at reduced speed. At one point the train manager even passed bottles of water along the train 'to be given to children and infants only'.This is certainly one birthday trip I shall not forget and I shall keep contacting Virgin until we get a response, an apology and a refund.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2014-11-01T20:06:34Z	Dont complain direct you never get answers	Well i have complained to Virgintrains and i am still waiting for my reply its been 7 WEEKS Now not even acknowledgement, there trains are horrible smelly and the staff look scruffy. you cancelled my train no explanation and no apology you cost me my holiday by 1 day as i missed my flight many thanks	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2020-08-07T10:14:54Z	31degrees heat...NO AIRCON! Stifling and uncomfortable	Arrived on time-gets 1 star for that. No WiFi at all even though it’s advertised. The main issue was that there was absolutely NO air con. Can’t open a window. Absolutely stifling. Difficult to continue to wear your mask as it’s hard to breathe in that heat. Disgusting. Really uncomfortable journey. No staff around to speak to.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2020-08-07T10:14:54Z	Too expensive considering its a ordinary train	The prices for Virgin trains are simply absurd considering they travel the same directions as other train companies. London north-east railway charges approx 12 pounds to go from Hertfordshire to London, however Virgin trains charged me 85 pounds to go from Wolverhampton to Wigan Wallgate! Never again will i go near this train company as even National Express charges only 22 pounds to go from London to Liverpool and thats 300 miles of distance comparing to how greedy Virgin trains are considering inside is a plain ordinary train!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2020-08-07T10:14:54Z	Defrauded by Avanti	I purchased a first class ticket and the only refreshments offered by virgin were water. Friday is a weekday service and alcohol and food are supposed to be included in the price of the ticket. I feel that Avanti are using the covid situation to exploit customers, disgusting.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

2020-08-07T10:14:54Z	Got a train ticket allowing me to use…	"Got a train ticket allowing me to use any trains to my destination, including return ticket using any route.I got to my destination without any issues.On my return, the ticket guy told me that my ""All Trains Allowed Virgin Ticket"" was to be used on any train EXCEPT Virgin trains.I was confused, and asked him to explain, he said that Virgin Trains sell tickets to many Train Providers, and my ticket was to be used by all other train Providers EXCLUDING Virgin Trains.I Was still confused, on why Virgin Trains would sell tickets to their direct competitors, it makes no sense. Even if this was the case, the Ticket would have to Explicitly explain that.How can a Ticket Bough on the Virgin Trains Website ""Giving Access to ALL TRAINS"" would EXCLUDE Virgin Trains. They have so much money, why not add this information as a ""Warning"" on the website when you are buying this type of ticket, and send an email containing this information. Isn't this very important? I explained to the Ticket Guy that this sounded like a scam, as by omitting this information they can get more money in fines from people boarding trains that they think that they are allowed in.I told him that I was sorry for the confusion and would leave on the next stop, as I don't care about the train that I'm in, I can just wait for another one. The Ticket guy didn't care, insisting and insisting and insisting that I would have to pay extra, treating me as a thief, a liar, and a criminal. Such a disgusting customer service, in the end, I paid for the Ticket Guy (just to avoid issues) and said to that Ticket Guy that I hope he buys a similar service from an Incompetent Company such as Virgin Trains, and have to pay extra for that service while being treated like a criminal.Such as buying a Ticket for Disneyland giving access to All Parks, and then be told that the Disney Ticket for All Parks would allow you to use any Amusement Park in the region EXCEPT Disney Parks. And be treated as a criminal, while being forced to pay a much more expensive price for that access to Disneyland even if you just said you can just leave the park, they will make you pay for the overpriced ticket.Ridiculous!   Disgusting!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1
2020-08-07T10:14:54Z	Virgin Trains when First Class just means a more expensive ticket	Booked to Virgin Trains from London to Manchester to take my son on a university open day. I booked first class as a treat but was wildly unimpressed. Didn't realise that weekend service is not half as good as the weekday service. No hot food. No alcohol. Not much point really but fair enough that was my mistake.On the return leg there was disruption and we were told to get on another train. There was no first class service. No hot drinks served to your table. No free bottles of water. Nothing just a larger seat. We were told we could go to the buffet car which was closing soon and pick up hot drinks and water for the remainder of the journey, which I did. But again this wasn't what I'd paid half as much again for. Somebody did come on at a later station but just handed us a sandwich and was gone, never to return. No water. No hot drinks.When you pay for first class, that is what you expect, and you pay a premium for it. I thought it would be a nice treat but I felt really disappointed. I complained to Virgin Trains but they basically said tough. They weren't interested in either apologising or offering me a partial refund. In fact, the guy treated me as if I was stupid, so he could move on to disappointing the next customer.I'm happy to pay for good service, but this was just a waste of money. Don't bother. And they don't care if you're satisfied or not. Richard Branson just puts his name on it and walks away as he doesn't care either, just as long as it's making him money.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2
2020-08-07T10:14:54Z	I went on a virgin train some years ago…	I went on a virgin train some years ago from Preston to Glasgow it was one amazing experience the train was at first over crowded but I and some others got moved and ended up on first class area and seating I had 2 free colas on the journey it was really relaxed comfy area not to many people there at all first class. The staff and the ticket inspector was absolutely outstanding brilliant really good nothing was too much trouble. The journey itself wasnt at all bad I had wifi and was be able to contact family and friends tell them where I was and I was on the train. All the staff was brilliant and kept us all informed on times and journey virgin train was clean tidy and comfy. I would definitely recommend and would use them again. I went to Glasgow to see friends on june 2016 setting off from Grimsby via Manchester then to Preston then from Preston to Glasgow long journey but with doing in my eyes I had to stay and get the train to Preston because of the thunderstorm we had on that day and the train lines were down but the journey was superb couldnt fault the staff on the virgin trains.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	5

Had to ring their telesales. OK. The call cost me £12... as it was an 0871 number. Bad. They do something to make up for letting you down, then smear it in your face by charging a £1 a minute for the privilege of them fixing their own initial mistake. Shoddy.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	2

I chose virgin because I liked the fa t the promote WiFi.The train had no WiFi, there or on the return journey. I selected my seats. When I got the tickets, there was no seats selected. Had to find a random seat there and back. Moving a couple of times. Exyremtly depressed there and back. Effected my whole London weekend mood. Would travel with the caledonian nights sleeper next time as its £90 only. Or the citylink bus from as little as £20 and it only takes and extra 2 hours.When I complained to virgin they said they don't promote the use of WiFi so I screen shotted all the promotional material available highlighting there on board services. When I proved this point with evidence he moved on to stating and ignoring me, not saying sorry. And talking about other trains that are being upgraded but in Wales, am in Scotland hahah I told him it's not relevant. They don't have a clue how to really deal with people simpley patronising people or making out one thing and lying about another. I hate this company and hope they go bust.

Out of all these journeys I got served my allocated meal just once, as one of the staff had to go look in another cart that was from a previous service. 95 percent of the staff were rude and not knowledgable when it comes to food dietary needs. Stating that you have  a gluten free meals and then not being able to get one is abominable. Customer service has given me the same generic response twice in a row for the past two years and that is  not acceptable especially when compared to the quality of business they claim to offer or say they will strive to improve in the emails I've received yet for the past two years it only seems to have gotten worse.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk	1

Though I spent £15.20 on the ticket they did not EVEN refunded me £5.20. I have never contacted Virgin Trains for anything. First time. This is disgusting and this company should be prosecuted. By the consumers right everyone has the right of a refund for a limited period of time after purchase. This company is acting unlawfully. Just because it is on their T&C. Disgusting!

2020-02-21T08:15:32Z	Shambles of poor service and customer care.	"Bit of a rant but felt the need to be honest and comprehensive. Decent trains, very expensive travel, no catering at all and rude staff with some aggressive managers (some managers appear competent and are friendly, but that clear distinction says it all) Customer complaints team ignore issues and state party line basically repeating nonsense about their level of service and non conformance to passenger charter. Menus are not close to what they provide. Why microwave bread, effectively turning it into wet dough, and sell it as ""toasted"", surely against trade descriptions and good sense. Why ""stock up"" after 3 hours of the journey with 1 macaroni, why no stock at all at start of the 7+ hour journey? Why say you provide food when even your onboard staff agree you don't ever stock what is on the menu? Why don't you prepare to sell food at your hugely inflated prices, and avoid another administration, waste of cash rebranding and government bail out, fail to plan, plan to fail etc. Why lie and say these issues are rare when i do this journey regularly and these issues are always the same, the presence of food is the rarity. Why is James Martin associating himself with all these poor travel related outlets, would he microwave bread and sell it as toasted, his brand must be toast by now. Why only stock porridge, sweeties, crisps and booze (oh, don't forget the wet microwaved ""toasties"" ) for the Scottish part of the journey (stereotyping perhaps but i don't see jellied eels being stocked in London so suspect its just basic incompetence). Why let second class (definitely not ""standard"" class, another piece of pr spin) kids starve, or eat porridge and sweets, while serving chicken chasseur to 1st class (1st class stocked, second class not)? Also, Trains are often freezing, or far too hot in summer, suspect this is due to poor temp checks and control from staff rather than lack of ability to control temp. Just generally very poor service with no apparent motivation to address it, based on my significant experience on this route, comments from staff and various escalations within Lner."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	2

2020-02-21T08:15:32Z	First class, third rate.	I was expecting an improvement in service after being taken over by LNER - it’s worse than Virgin. With the exception of a couple of staff members who managed a smile and a hello, the customer services team don’t seem best suited to serving customers. Passive aggressive isn’t too far an exaggeration. On top of that - no hot food on the way to Newcastle due to staff shortage, no seat reservations on the way back to London due to a printer fault, no credit card facilities due to I don’t know what, and a broken chair both ways. One of the staff was walking in and out of the carriage doorway loading a trolley while people were trying to board the train, grumbling excuse me please while she carried on doing it. Another pushed past me while I was putting my case in the rack, instead of waiting all of three or four seconds for me to finish doing it. It all points to bad management and poor treatment of employees - they just don’t seem happy at all. I’ll be flying in future, it’s no longer a first class service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1

2020-02-21T08:15:32Z	Freezing/Noisy/Yuk	As I was travelling from Edinburgh to Newcastle, I opted for a first class ticket as a treat.1, The carriage was cold and drafty the whole whole journey due the door between the two first class carriages being jammed open. It could not be shut because it was jammed. I had to wear 2 coats and a pair of gloves to stay warm as my seat particularly caught the draft. (coach K seat 33).2, The carriage was far from quiet, the main noise being from the loud voices of the cabin crew and the clanking of drinks bottles in the service area, (the door not being kept shut). The constant collection of rubbish was an unnecessary disturbance.3, The food consisted of fridge-cold sandwiches, a packet of crisps and a disappointing packaged cake. A hot meal was supposed to have been served, but none were delivered to the train either in Edinburgh or in Newcastle.In addition, the train was over half an hour late, but this was not due to Virgin East Coast's service. The above three complaints were entirely due to poor maintenance of the carriage, poor staff training and poor quality menus and catering service and entirely the responsibility of Virgin East Coast Trains. For the price of £102.00, I had expected better. My second class journey on the way up to Newcastle was much better. No need to book first class again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1

All that is offered is a crappy bacon sandwich (one piece of bacon between two pieces of white unbuttered bread) (I asked for wholemeal) and a sausage sandwich on wholemeal when white was requested. oh and porridge. Ask them to take my cup away so I have more table space (as there is no hot water so why would I need to keep the cup for two hours) to be told to leave it on the table. Oh and when the train has already departed they announce the card machine is not working in the on board buffet shop. unless they have a cash point on board - I won't be buying anything for the entire 2 hours either. shocking and I'm expecting a refund. am yet to experience the excuses of the return journey yet. think the staff are also rude.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1

I had originally directed my claim towards Virgin Trains, as it was from them that I’d purchased my tickets, & on the day I’d travelled on trains from a number of different operators, & the information given to passengers on the day was not sufficient to identify which operator bears responsibility (I’m confident they’ll all claim that they hold no responsibility).   I wonder if you could identify whether this is a suitable time to chase the company for an update?  The journey was on 28/12/17, I submitted a claim to Virgin 31/12/17, your assistance transferred the claim to Virgin East Coast 02/02/18 & since then I have heard from Virgin East Coast only once.  As I’m sure you are aware they do not respond to customer e-mails.  The only way to elicit a response is to write an extremely negative comment on social media; it was just such a comment which enabled me to identify on 20/02/18 that the new claim reference number is XXX-######XXXX.  Since then: nothing, & it’s March.  The train companies all boast of their automatic “delay repay” schemes.  I’m surprised that they do not also boast about their menageries of unicorns, flying pigs & mermaids.

2018-04-26T13:31:36Z	Everyone in the Borders hates Virgin	I have hated Virgin for as long as they have been running the East Coast Mainline. I used to live in Berwick upon Tweed and was basically driven out of the town because the trains are so unreliable and so expensive. For a journey of 45 minutes  from Berwick to Newcastle the open return now costs £29 and at weekends there are never any cheaper advance fares available, so a shopping trip to Newcastle has become prohibitively expensive. I have repeatedly missed appointments because of broken down trains, failed overhead lines, etc. During the recent snow the line north of Newcastle was blocked for days, and while I accept this is the responsibility of Network Rail, what really makes me angry is that Virgin's response to this is to issue a blanket announcement, 'Do not travel'. No attempt to provide details of where exactly the problems are and how to get round them. Every day just, don't travel.  I am delighted that Virgin has abandoned the east coast franchise and would like to see it re-nationalised, but I am so angry about the way they have scammed the taxpayer.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2018-04-26T13:31:36Z	Cancelled train journey, Newcastle to Edinburgh	Train journey Newcastle to Edinburgh with first class ticket. Due to a broken down train on the track, our train never made it to Edinburgh.  After stopping and waiting on the tracks, it was diverted to Dunbar. At Dunbar we were told that the train was turning around and going back to Newcastle. To continue the journey to Edinburgh we had to get off & wait 30 mins for another train. Similar problems again, this 2nd train then stopped for a further 1/2 hour. Ended up well over 2.5 hours late into Edinburgh, missed the important appointment and ran up substantial costs to reschedule another one later that day.  Spoke with Virgin Rail and was advised by customer services to write them an email and send photocopies of all the receipts for the additional costs incurred due to this train delay, which we did.They acknowledged our email, but then chose to ignore it. After 4 weeks with no further reply, we contacted Virgin, they confirmed that they had received our email (with the documents), but they had done nothing about it. It was quite shocking to hear this, it's very poor customer service. In summary, we were never given a complete refund of the extra costs incurred, but were instead given a meagre and very disappointing settlement. The whole experience was very poor and it's not a nice way for them to treat their passengers. Whilst on the phone I asked why they could spend so much time doing things like banning the sale of the Daily Mail onboard their trains, whilst at the same time, doing so little for their customers.

2018-04-26T13:31:36Z	Awful website and call handlers	Awful website,  online and telesales (which is overseas!!?) support. My virgin account website wouldn't work. Spoke to Web Support and they were rude and unhelpful,  operator refused to let me speak to anyone else proceded to put me on loud speaker and basically laugh at me!?!  This after I'd spent two hours on the site, tried to ring telesales but they have no link to the web so refused the free wifi despite me spending two hours trying to book online and on web support. I ended up creating a new account with a different email on a different browser.Web support were hopeless.  This was my idea and it worked.  I really miss the simplicity of booking through National Rail Enquiries.Argh thumbs down for their call handlers and website	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2018-04-26T13:31:36Z	5 out of 5 for Virgin Staff	Train i was booked on lost power. The Virgin Customer Service staff very helpful at Wakefield and Doncaster. Felt very looked after and felt they were genuinely concerned i got home ok. Staff 5 out of 5. Thank you! But took off a star as whenever i catch this train (about 3 times a year) it is always delayed. Maybe it is just bad luck.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	4
2018-04-26T13:31:36Z	Awful	Consistently late, poor connections and no apologies if your travelling to and from  North of Newcastle.  No complaint is ever answered properly even if your a season ticket holder. At best you get a standardised marketing apology. It's expensive,  toilets are dirty. Quite frankly a disgrace.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2018-04-26T13:31:36Z	Uncomfortable seats and horrible customer service	It is almost impossible to reach their customer service. I don't even like to write a comprehensive review here and waste even more time with this. I needed to book two tickets for the same journey, because it is unclear whether I will receive a refund for one of them after having to change the dates of travel. It is impossible to reach them via phone or email and they don't contact me as they promised in their rubbish internet form that I needed to fill out. When you are used to continental European trains, don't expect too much. The distances of the seats is so small that as a full grown man you can't even open your laptop and work on it. It is so shaky on the Newcastle London journey anyway that your hard drive might get damaged. I am not joking. Also the back rest forces you in a extremely uncomfortable posture. I hate to go with those trains even though they look nice. But no star for looking nice from me.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2018-04-26T13:31:36Z	We had a supposedly first class journey …	We had a supposedly first class journey with Virgin Trains East Coast last September, from London to Edinburgh then Gleneagles return. The 'first class' service was almost non-existent, no complimentary drinks and horrible sandwich food. The journey back was worse. The train was two hours late, there was no bar and no food offered. The reason I was given was that as it was a Saturday, football fans caused trouble hence the reason the bar was closed! The toilet was dirty and there were no paper towels. I emailed the company to complain and phone customer service (don't do the latter, they are useless and can't understand what you are saying). Having not received a reply I emailed and wrote again. They finally sent me an email which was basically a marketing email extolling the qualities of the company! Still no apology or offer of compensation. At this point in time, four months after the journey, I still await an offer of compensation. Next time I'll fly.....	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1

2018-04-26T13:31:36Z	Evidently they couldn't care less	It seems most of what I was about to write has already been covered in these reviews.

Service in first class varies from good to not so good. Overall first class now very expensive for what you get. Quite coaches being removed in first class. Bad idea. Not every one wants to listen to other peoples  mobile phone calls on the train. It is a real pity East Coast trains were refranchised.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	2

I did a return journey from Newcastle to London, and in the ""Rest of the Day"" menu is a choice of alcoholic drinks. On both journeys none were offered, or according to the staff, available.

Today I was travelling with my wife (happy 40th love!) and our 3 daughters to London on the Retford 10:40am service. To say I was impressed with the service is an understatement (especially Jo who was VERY attentive).

Rude staff3. Food was unavailable and coffee was cold4. Dirty tables and toilets 5. WiFi didn’t work. I asked for a refund or at least some money off a future ticket but no such luck. They did reply and didn’t give a reason for 1, 2, and 4, but said 3 and 5 were complimentary and not included in the ticket price. Horrible company and if I could avoid using them I would.

It seems to have been purposefully desgined to be awkward, difficut and horrible to use to ensure no one ever uses it. I shall only use trainline from now on. I have tried twice now to change a ticket and get a refund on the ticket I can no longer use and had to re-verify my account twice, once I was already in my account and then found out it would take 48 hours for the ticket I was trying to change to show up..or something. I lost the will to live trying to figure out how I could get my ten quid back. it used to be simple and elegant to change a ticket. I hope that the extra money they are making is worth it to Virgin for the totally abysmal customer relations they are fostering.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2018-01-26T10:09:33Z	Virgin East Coast web site is dire	Recent changes to their website are dire, making it far more difficult to process tickets and refunds.

2018-01-26T10:09:33Z	Purposefully Obtuse Customer Services	"In a nut shell; if the website doesn't work don't bother trying the telephone number its simply not worth wasting life's precious moments on a fruitless exercise. In my case it was a login issue, my registration information had been lost when they switched to their new website, so the system asked for a re-register. However, the one piece of my personal data that they hadn't lost is my email address. And you guessed it; re-registration error message ""email already in use please login"" The one thing I did manage to ascertain, during a painful 30 minutes on the phone, is that it takes 48-72 hours for something to happen. I'm not sure what exactly, in fact,  I'm still a little bit stunned that I had to explain how return journeys work. Like I say it just not worth it. Hang on I've just realised why I'm writing this review now, given that I'm always travelling on Virgin Trains, its because I normally book via Trainline.comEdit: Well, having tried to book directly with Virgin and wasted 4 hours of my time on the phone, a week has past and I'm now £700 down because the cheaper tickets are no longer available. But hey they did offer £25 as a gesture of good will. There is no good will, offer declined.My only worry now is where has my lost personal information gone????"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1

The train that died then came back to life and was only 29 minutes late is a classic.must have gone very fast, and empty, to make up the lost hour!

This is the second time this has happened to me with Virgin East Coast. In the earlier days with them this sort of thing didn't happen.

They  held the train up for a minute or so, and got me into the first class carriage as we was unaware of the coach and seat number.  By this time I was quite upset as I thought I was going to miss the train and was going to a special birthday celebration The buffet staff were lovely to me and a guy said do not worry we will go find the guard. The guard was a lovely young man, who said do not worry love, we will look after you, .Told me I could stay in First class, not many people in, which I did and   was offered food and drink,  Was a lovely journey.When we arrived in Leeds,  the train terminating there, the guard appeared, took my case, asked If I was ok.  I thanked him so much for his care and kindness. Also the guy  from the buffet car and shook my hand.What can you possibly say about the care and consideration shown to me. Unbeatable service.Thank you all so muchThis review was Beryl Moulsons review not Roger as stated !!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	5
2017-11-18T08:31:39Z	Virgin Trains is a disgrace	Virgin Trains is a disgrace. They are happy to take your money when buying a ticket, the phone is answered instantly, but when it comes to calling them regarding a refund, you have no chance of them answering the phone. On three separate occasions I have tried to phone their so called customer services and each time been on hold for over an hour and at a premium rate phone number it is not cheap. They dont even tell where you are in the Que to give you any indication you are actually moving nearer to speaking to someone. All it repeats is we will get you though to an adviser as soon as we can and then it plays the most irritating music you have ever heard, but the adviser never comes, and after wasting so much time and money on hold for an hour and ten minutes each time you just have to put the phone down.It is so frustrating.I really feel this is done on purpose so people just give up and let them keep the money, because the time and money and stress spent trying to get back what you are entitled to is just to much.  My daughter was stuck on one of their trains very late at night for two hours in almost total darkness as there was no power. We sent in the ticket and all details to claim the full refund for the fare as they say you are entitled to after an hours delay. The reply by email was she is not entitled to a refund because the train was only delayed for 1 minute. You cant reply to the email and they state you have to ring them if you have any further questions. But strangely enough no one answers the phone. This company must be making an absolute fortune from not giving customers back there refunds when they are entitled and people just give up trying due to such terrible customer service. It is disgraceful how they are allowed to carry on like this they dont deserve there licence as a transport company.We are also waiting for two more refunds for tickets that had to be changed but where re-booked on a different day, but no refund has ever emerged for these journeys and its been over a month now. Total they owe in refunds now is £80.00. More needs to be done to make this  company accountable for the refunds they owe customers sort there severe lack of customer services out or more appropriately it should be called customer disservices.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-11-18T08:31:39Z	Rubbish Customer Service	Trying to receive refund for change of journey despite speaking to two representatives, completing enquiry on line and completing complaint on line I am still waiting this is alongside the time wasted holding to be put through no wonder always experiencing high volume of calls presumably all complaints !!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-11-18T08:31:39Z	still smell of poo	Extremely horrible customer service. Does not value the customer at all. They would rather take the money and lose a customer in the long run. No business ethics at all. Does not listen to nor understand the grievances of the customer. This is a so-called service company that does not understand the fundamental reason for why they are in business in the first place. Repeats over and over again stock phrases as if the customer is not even a person. They are not helpful at all. They only care about protecting themselves with no considerations on why the customer is legitimately frustrated. They take your money without providing a service, unwilling to provide a refund and say they don't care because they have legal support. They said that verbatim over the phone. I recommend staying as far away from them as possible.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-11-18T08:31:39Z	Extremely horrible customer service	Appalling.

2017-11-18T08:31:39Z	Appalling. Unacceptable	Its getting worse i do the KX to Dundee on a monthly basis and to be trueful Im considering driving rather than putting up with the terrible standard of Virgin trains. When i first started using this service the food was not bad at least it was presentable now you get soggy sandwhich in plastic cardboard packaging and a menu that screams cheap crap. The staff are rude and very unhelpful. My recent journey spent over 5hrs with air-con on so high i could have been in Siberia (a journey i should imagine of better standard than this train service) if you asked the staff to adjust the system not only do they pass the buck their dam right rude. As for the toilets what is that about they stink to high heaven and really need a good clean, someone obviously doesn't know about hygiene standards. But why should virgin care they have the monopoly and one more passengers complaint is not going to make any difference to Richards pockets. At least I've made my thoughts known	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-11-18T08:31:39Z	A trip to Siberia would be more enjoyable	"I booked a ticket on my company credit card which, according to the website, was accepted. Then the tickets didn't arrive so I phoned the ""customer helpline"" only to be told, after 2 hours of waiting, that the payment was not accepted and therefore I would have to book again. I was told quite categorically that the problem was with my card!I also emailed them while waiting on the phone! It took over a week for them to acknowledge my email and then another week to formally respond. By this time, it had become apparently that Virgin HAD actually taken a payment from my company card so it wasn't a refusal by the card company, but a mistake by Virgin IT systems. I emailed to point this out, over a week ago, as I can't afford another 2 hour wait on the phone! Still no response!Total shambles since Virgin took over - I never once had a problem before that!I will not use them again, preferring to travel by East Midland Trains instead!They have an average rating of 1-star after all these reviews - when is someone going to investigate this franchise and take action!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-11-18T08:31:39Z	Payment but NO TICKET	I had a train service cancelled by Virgin last year which meant I couldn't travel, so they provided me with a replacement ticket to be used another time. This was dated so could be used at any time on any service one year from the issue date. Unfortunately I needed to book a seat as I didn't want to stand from Peterborough to Edinburgh.I spent 55 minutes on hold to Customer Services and then had to give up as the call was never answered. There are many similar testimonies on here, so the message is clear; Virgin don't give a poo about customer service.Thanks again to Theresa May and her friends for taking an excellent service when in public hands and returning it to a private franchisee who only wants to make profit	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-11-18T08:31:39Z	Unacceptable lack of Customer Service	I had to take an earlier train (0.5 hr) from Leeds to London and conductor handed me an unpaid fare notice for 91 GBP. I did not pay and wanted to appeal against this  on the customer telephone line, but nobody replies. What a horrible customer Service!! I also emailed them with no reply.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-11-18T08:31:39Z	I had to take an earlier train (0.5 hr) …	After a month, I was informed by Virgin I was due a refund on a ticket for a train that broke down. I was also advised that I should call a particular number to claim my refund. After 1 hour ten minutes of holding I had to give up. I have subsequently called another number to complain about their service and have so far been held for 50 minutes. Diabolical Service! I hope you read this Mr Branson. Your service is crap.I'm now on to day two. I have made two further attempts of one hour in duration and still no one has picked up the phone. Seems like to system has been designed to deter customer feedback or refunds. I shall continue. So far, I have spent four hours trying to claim a refund. I shall keep updating this until I do.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-11-18T08:31:39Z	Strip them of the franchise.	I booked a ticket on the website and requested a refund on the my account section on the same day before the payment was taken. They charged me anyway and didn't reply to my request for a refund, nor is there any information on the website with a status update. So I decided to get a reply I'd have to call them, and I could write an essay on why this is the worst customer phone lines I've ever used. The 'web support' team in Edinburgh don't answer their phone ever it seems. So I call back to the sales team who surprise surprise answered quite quickly. They recommended I call the customer complaints number instead, so I tried that and I've now been on the phone for 30 minutes with no sign of an answer. This company is a disgrace and should never have taken the franchise off East Coast who were state run. If there's ever been a better example of why privatisation of the rail network was a terrible idea this is it. Where is the customer service, the supposedly 'innovative' private sector? You can't even answer a phone to a customer with a legitimate complaint. I'll be trying every other option in future rather than get on one of virgins trains. Richard Branson and the whole company should be ashamed of themselves. You're not doing the bare minimum to keep a franchise, you're doing less and I hope for the public's sake you lose it very soon.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-11-18T08:31:39Z	Terrible service. Customer phone line is woeful	Shame you can't give it no stars.  Dreadful company.  Having had an unsatisfactory response to a complaint, I wrote (proper hard copy letter) to the customer services rep on September 6th to explain my dissatisfaction and request a further response. As of 30th September I have not had the courtesy of an acknowledgement let alone a substantive reply.  Whether it is through renationalisation or a new franchisee, the sooner these people are removed from our railway system the better.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-11-18T08:31:39Z	Shame you can't give it no stars	Horrible experience. Firstly, their app is not working properly (1,7 stars out of 5 in Google Play). I purchased my ticket online and it was supposed to load in the app's wallet. Unfortunately, it didn't and therefore i had to go to the ticket desk in King's Cross and ask them to help me. A helpful lady tried to call internally but no one was there to answer the call and advice on what to do! As the train was leaving shortly, she decided to give me a handwritten piece of paper (with an official stamp) stating that i have paid for the ticket. I had the booking confirmation with the date, price and an email saying my card was charged. All evidence was there. Yet, the ticket inspector was extremely rude. In front of the passengers he humiliated me. I have never felt so awful in my life, it made me feel like i was a thief. I had paid 134 pounds for a one way ticket to Edinburgh from London (!!) but he didn't care at all if the app malfunctioned or if i had paid my ticket. To the company:a. improve your technology and apps. It's ridiculous and quite embarassing to have such useless app that does not work properly in 2017. check the reviews again before you download it!b. Teach your employees to treat the passengers nicely and tell them to be calm before they start blaming them for issues that the Virgin trains East Coast company is in charge of. Extremely rude staff, they don't care about the passengers at all. Zero respect and professionalism.To make a long story short, i was forced to pay again 134 pounds and a new ticket and the inspector told me to ask for a refund for the old one. Basically, i spent 268 pounds within 1 hour. What if i didn't have the money to pay for the extra ticket? I guess they would have kicked me out in the next stop.I made a complaint about the above, but it seems they do not care about their customers and they do not want to improve their services. Guess it was my fault i trusted them for my trip. Their app goes straight to the bin + i'd rather fly by plane or check other ways of travelling rather than having to deal with such awful experience and give them my money.Avoid them!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-11-18T08:31:39Z	horrible service and staff - avoid!	For 2nd time in a month I have been on a failed train. Right now I have been stranded on a hot train, no aircon near Peterborough for over 3 hrs. The device that feeds electricity from the overheads completely failed in a series of bangs and flashes, causing the train to grind to a halt.Virgin are charging a lot of money for their services and operating ancient rolling stock. Be warned. I am spending Saturday night and maybe Sunday morning in an overheated carriage. Thanks Virgin you really screwed up this time!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-11-18T08:31:39Z	For 2nd time in a month I have been on …	"No platform for train displayed on Kings Cross notice board and only caught the train because we overheard someone saying the platform number. All the Virgin staff at Kings Cross said was to wait for the platform number to be displayed. If we had done that, we would still be waiting for it. Useless, unhelpful and ignorant staff who are supposed to be working for a flagship company who's boss lives the life or riley in the Carribean and doesn't give a flying fig about you or me.The train was packed, uncomfortable and not very clean, let alone the fact that it seemed or appeared to be about 20 years old.The return journey was somewhat better and the train probably a lot newer than the heap of c**p that we travelled to Edinburgh on but the the platform staff at Edinburgh were just the same as they were in London. Not interested, almost rude and certainly lacking in customer service.  Must be the way they are trained to interact with their wage payers, more like we are here doing you a favour and you should be grateful that we are. As for thier website tag line: ""Where are you heading?""Well, with a bit of luck and with the attitude that Virgin trains staff have, it should be down the pan.Note to self: Fly next time or drive, both will be better than letting the ""train"" take the strain, especially a Virgin train."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-11-18T08:31:39Z	Arrogant staff and awful train service.	Staff are generally slack and rude and no customer service at all.As a regular customer on the east coast mainline over the last 20 years i would say GNER should have had a lifetime franchise as it were the best service i have ever experienced.The virgin brand portrays a chav experience and some of the staff are scruffy with there uniforms.As a 1st class customer coach k is never the quiet coach as members of staff talk and laugh so loud and you can hear their mobiles!This happens reguarly on the 0655 skipton to kings cross.Please consider moving the quiet coach back to coach M.I was looking forward to virgin winning the franchise but have now revealed their true colours.May switch to grand central or grand alliance when trains start running from preston.Your loss guys.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-09-12T22:00:13Z	small-print robbery	Had an advance ticket (£36) from Newcastle to London, unfortunately missed it and took next one departing at 20:06.So treated as having no ticket and charge max price £149 one-way for missing a train. And the train is almost empty and definitely not peak time and in fact running late! It's shocking as to what an unpleasant this journey is for something that's reasonable to happen (who wants to miss a train intentionally?). Anyway a small-print robbery! Definitely should have taken plane cheaper and faster.No wonder why Virgin Train East Coast is running at a loss for such hostile pricing and kill the chicken for the egg short-sightedness.

2017-09-12T22:00:13Z	Advance saver fares on Virgin Trains East Coast	I went on the Virgin Trains East Coast website today, in order to book a trip to Edinburgh in November.They have introduced a new 'booking engine' that purports to make the process easier, but if my experience is typical, this is a creative way of increasing fares. There are few direct trains to Edinburgh, from my home station of Morpeth, but the alternative is to change at Newcastle Central. This makes the journey longer, but still viable.Formerly, I could obtain advance saver tickets for most trains from Morpeth, but now they are only offering the cheaper advance fares on the direct trains, designating the others as 'sold out', even though they were never on sale at the reduced rate. Also, there are very limited number of saver fares for each journey, so one needs to act promptly to secure one. Incidentally, the offers become available twenty four weeks in advance for weekdays and twelve for weekends, at about ten am on Friday mornings.The main message, though, is that Virgin, since they took over from East Coast Main Line, have increased the price and reduced the scope of the advance fares. Whether they made complementary reductions elsewhere is difficult to know, but seems doubtful. It is also uncertain if the vaunted new policy of allowing passengers to book at saver rates on the day of travel, will benefit many.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	3

Go to take a can of Diet Coke, then am chased down the carriages by a staff member, who shouts at me in front of everyone, saying ""Don't ever do that again!"" and ""Naughty, naughty, naughty!""

2017-09-12T22:00:13Z	An Awful Experience	It was relatively easy to book our First Class round trip tickets from London King Cross to Edinburgh, In my attempt to confirm luggage details (not 100% provided) it took four phone calls, not including being transferred back and forth between departments just to get basic information. Thank God I finally contacted a sweet young lady familiar with luggage who provided me with useful information. At Kings Cross we found it quite difficult to locate the train for departure. Prior to purchase I was told (over the phone) Virgin would have employees (in red jackets) stationed to provide direction or answers to general questions.  We were disappointed that the only Virgin employees we came across were physically on the train. The trains did not have “Virgin” or any identifying markings on the sides as in their advertising indicates.The hilarious part of this search is that we were instructed by Kings Cross employees to take lifts down or up in various locations within the station as it appeared that few Kings Cross employees were familiar with Virgin. Through observation it appeared other travelers were as confused as we were. Seasoned travelers know the drill.The outbound trip was uneventful except it was “extremely” rough, and because of this, we had to physically hold our drinks and snacks from bouncing off the table. This is no joke as it was like a carnival ride. Over the years I had taken hundreds of nice photos out of train, bus and aircraft windows, but it was totally impossible to take any decent photos from the outbound trip as they were all blurry from bouncing up and down and from side to side. The primary reason we placed this train journey was to enjoy the view and take memorable photos.Since I was not sure of our return date I placed seating arrangements only for the outbound trip. Once in Scotland we finalized our adventures and contacted Virgin to set up the return trip. Since it was Friday evening I was told I would not receive an answer for my return trip request for approximately 3 days. Monday afternoon I finally received an email from Virgin informing me that my seating request could not be met. I was expecting to be provided with other travel options (time/day) as time for my return was running out. It took 6 (six) calls and numerous internal transfers to find anyone who cared. The successful call took 45 minutes of nonsense before I was transferred to Ali who saved the day. Ali was not in the correct department but assured me that he would follow up and get our seating arranged after I explained my plight. Prior to being transferred to Ali I had been having a conversation with the correct department. What is going on?The return journey was substantially smoother. While my wife was snoozing and I was reading, we missed the provided snack as the Virgin stewardess quickly pushed the snack cart through the isle speaking too softly to alert us. On aircraft coach (not even first class) stewardess “always” alert each and every passenger of their presents. Not Virgin. Your “friendly” stewardess was “clearly upset” when I finally got her attention on her return trip when I requested a snack. She actually gave me a lecture on paying attention. Out of guilt, I ordered a cold sandwich over a hot meal that was absolutely horrible. Local markets and cafes offer quality sandwiches for less than 3 pounds. This sandwich had a single slice of meat about the thickness of a piece of bond paper and was tasteless. What a joke! In her haste to leave the stewardess failed to bring the rest of our order.Yes, for £768.00 we did expect much-much more. Filing a complaint has foreigners going in circles.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1

I have taken to travelling and couple of hours before any major meetings as I have been delayed so many times. But this week was even worse. I was told my ticket was invalid on the London to York service I was on - even though I had been told otherwise - and the 'revenue protection officer' tried to make me pay an extra £129. After the unhelpful guard had told me which train my ticket was valid on (including that same train after Peterborough - but I couldn't stay on it as I hadn't joined it there?!) I was told by the guard on the next train that my ticket wasn't valid on that service either! Anyway, I eventually got home much later than planned, and it had to involve a £30 taxi ride home as I missed the last train. Awful treatment by Virgin.

Had visions of a nice relaxing trip where people could snooze, enjoy the countryside and have a cup of tea on the way.The reality was shocking. Despite booking more than 2 months ago (via Trainline), I wasn't able to get reserved seats.  Aisles were totally blocked with people.  My parents had to stand for 4 hours. I was separated from my children and couldn't reach them. There was no way for anyone to reach the toilets, and definitely not the buffet car. People were changing nappies on tables. Not a staff member in sight.And that horror for the same price as our flight back.  Ridiculous.It beggars belief that Virgin can offer this service from a safety point of view, let alone a customer experience point of view.

I had the ticket for 7pm, however, I am not able to get on the train as it was overcrowded, so it was not possible to stand even. Me and my friend were advised to take the next train at 7.30pm, so we headed back to the gates. However, I have spotted that one of the 1st class carriages was not completely full, so we have asked whether we could possibly get on the train in that carriage, so he confirmed and let us in. Luckily, we managed to find 2 seats, which seemed reserved, but none actually came in during the whole journey. As we had standard ticket, the ticket inspector asked us to upgrade to 1st class which was £120 per person, so we did not have any options, but to pay. We were told that they might have run out of meals so had the remind them at least 5 times to check whether there was any food left. At the end, we got our meal, however, we were not given a desert with the excuse that the train was full and they can not pass through, and all of their staff looked angry and acted impolitely.

They spend vast sums of money on stupid irritating adverts plastered all over the place, rather than providing a decent affordable service.   Not everyone can book 6 months in advance (even though the price of advance tickets has even risen considerably since 2015) and many if not most have to travel last minute.  Its outrageous that you can end up paying 200-300% more than someone else for the same journey.  Everyone should have access to reasonably priced tickets at all times like everywhere else in Europe.

2017-07-14T14:50:14Z	BEWARE VIRGIN EAST COAST	To begin. I had bought tickets via the Train Line booking service to travel to Edinburgh from London Kings Cross. Normally I'm usually on the ball with these things and printed out my tickets at home. Day of departure and arrive in plenty of time to have a coffee. Sitting in the station concourse it suddenly occurred that my print outs were not the actual tickets needed to travel. In a panic I headed for the booking office where I was informed that I had to contact The Train Line. At this point I had about 15 minutes to departure. The booking assistant gave me a number to call and advised that I should get them to fax details over to them at Kings Cross. After a very tense time listening to the usual recorded options that pass for exceptional customer service, I managed to get them to fax over my booking. Remember I did have a print out proving my reservation and seat. Rushing back to the counter the man I saw couldn't have cared less.He finally got off his chair and ambled slowly towards a back office. When he emerged it was NOPE, nothing has come through. I looked at them all and as I walked away I shouted out 'So I am just meant to go home and not travel'. There was no response. I decided to get the train and used my 60 plus oyster to access the platform. I jumped on board just as the doors locked. Train supervisor was fantastic, looked at my print out and pointed me to my carriage. I was able to see my 95 year old aunt for the last time.The entire drama could have been avoided. I had made an error but the system had changed since my last journey and I did have proof of my booking but it wasn't direct with Virgin and so they did everything to make things difficult. Now my current booking. A first class return to Edinburgh which I booked via an e mail promotion quite some time ago, before my aunt passed. An excellent fare, or so it seems. Virgin are con merchants.Do not trust them and if you can avoid do so. My advance ticket is changeable for a fee. My aunt is now dead and I have cancer with some new complications. I don't know when I want to travel or if I will eventually travel. If I attempt to push my booking out the full 6 months allowed, guess what? I can get an amazing one way journey for £7.95. Yep a bargain. Like f.....g hell it is. Once I've booked this then another change (bearing in mind that each change costs £10) means I've only got 7.95 in my kitty. On top of this there is the dodgy rail card discount which didn't apply to this fare as well as The Train Line offering a better fare to Glasgow (where I really wanted to be) shortly after I had booked this fare.The entire process is a disgrace. You are forced to book ahead because the fares are disgustingly expensive and they PRETEND to offer you flexibility we'll sort of by allowing you to change your reservation but it's a sham, a con job. What I want is the simple ability to keep my £78 in credit for use when I am able. Not a big deal. Easy, simple and fair. It was easier with Qantas and Virgin Australia to alter my plans when I had double pneumonia and 36 hours to live or die. Virgin East Coast. Rubbish! E mails to their contact site are never answered. Their web site is not easy to use and overall while I do enjoy the 4 hour plus journey I won't be using their service again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1

They then refused to refund my ticket cost and then failed to reply to subsequent enquiry.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-07-14T14:50:14Z	Fantastic Scotland service Edinburgh to Inverness.	16/02/2017 travelled with Virgin Train from Edinburgh to Inverness via Pitlochry. The updated Virgin trains are so comfortable and the service from the staff was excellent. We travelled first class at a very reasonable fare and was happily surprised with the comfort and service. If you compare the Virgin service to the Scotrail service on the same line then Virgin trains sits head and shoulders above Scotrail both in comfort and Service. I am not normally a fan of train travel in the UK but this experience has changed my opinion. Normally we would hire a car for the journey but on this occasion the train turned out to be amazing. If you are flexible when you travel you can get great deals. I highly recommend using the Virgin east coast train service and we will definitely be using again. So relaxing not having to drive and have an enjoyable meal and plenty of free drinks on the way. Well done Virgin you have converted a non-train user.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	5
2017-07-14T14:50:14Z	Poor customer service and misleading offers	"We have booked to travel to Durham on Monday using Virgin East Coast trains. Today I received an email offering us the chance to upgrade to First Class for £20 each. We decided to do so, as it seemed like a relatively reasonable price to make the journey a possible treat. However I then noticed that this ""offer"" could not be used in conjunction with our Senior railcards. This restriction seemed so illogical and downright mean minded that I rang Virgin's customer services to check if it was correct. The first time I worked my way through the irritating phone menus to what I thought was the right option I was subjected to loud music for several minutes and then the line went dead. The second time I tried a different route through the menus and did speak to a customer assistant, in what seemed to be a non UK call centre, which I do not object to on any grounds other than it seems to be ridiculous to be discussing a trip to Durham with someone who is probably on the Indian sub continent. Anyway, he confirmed that we could not upgrade to First Class if we had used our railcards when booking but said that this was the general rule and that he could give me another number to try to see if perhaps there could be an exception, or so the implication was. I waited for several minutes for him to return to give me this number (the matter of seconds surely) again listening to unpleasant loud music, and then put the phone down myself in frustration.Honestly - how can any multi billion pound company be so cheap as to deny us an ""Offer"", - which they have sent out and we did not seek -  to us because we used our rail cards when booking? Rail companies all subscribe to the use of railcards, for which we pay, as a way of giving discounts and to use them later as a way of denying us an offer is just tawdry and mean spirited, as well as poor business practice.  What sense does this make? The First class seats will probably be unused and we would have paid Virgin £40 to use them. We are now left considerably less happy than we would have been had Virgin not sent us their spurious offer, which in fact transpired not to be an offer at all. And we have not even set out yet!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	2
2017-07-14T14:50:14Z	Not worth the money	Very disappointed in the journey (Edinburgh to London) as a whole. We upgraded to a first class, Quiet car (at an expense of 150 GBP) which was a waste of money. There were several families with loud children on the car and no effort whatsoever by the Train Guard to ask them to be a little more respectful of the other passengers. Wish we had saved our money and just stayed in our regular coach since we weren't able to relax anyway.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	2
2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	Great service	Had a day-trip to London from Newcastle with our four year old son. To make the most of the day we booked the 7pm train back from King's Cross, with a table as travelling with children can be fun and trying in equal measures.We boarded the train and took our booked seats. A few minutes later a rude lady and her ruder friend accused us of sitting in their seats. When we checked all our tickets we realised the seats were double-booked. They expected us to move as they bought from the office, whereas we (for some inexplicable reason) had booked from the comfort of our home. We had actually paid for our son even though under-5s are free because we wanted to guarantee a table for us all, so I was reluctant to traipse up and down carriages looking for another seat. Eventually one of the train staff came, told the ladies to stay where they were, took my son's hand and led us up the train. We eventually got to a free table in first class. My son was given snacks, my wife enjoyed a glass of wine, and I had a sandwich and a cuppa in my big comfy seat. The staff were more than pleasant, and kept checking on us, making our return home after a long day very enjoyable.As well as this the train was delayed a bit due to the guard's incoming train being late. This didn't seem to matter, thankfully, and we also got refunded part of our ticket cost due to the delay within about 10 days of travel.Thank you Virgin East Coast.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	5
2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	Thieves	If you buy a ticket and choose to get an e-ticket you are no longer able to change the time/date of your train or get a refund. Even if you pay the admin fee. They hide this in their T&Cs. This wouldn't be acceptable in any other industry so don't know how they get away with this.Absolute robbery considering how expensive their tickets already are.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	Delay reppay delay... when does it become negligence?	"What is the point of bigging up delay repay on the train when they are seemingly unable to get it done. Got my confirmation email on the 1st of September, called to follow up end of September and they said they were ""a bit behind"". Now well into November and not a word. Avoid if you can / get your delay repaid at a ticket station if that is even possible."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	1st Class!!!- Stood full trip in corridor outside toilet!!	Paid over £400 for 3 1st class tickets from Peterbourgh to KIngs Cross yesterday.  We were forced to stand in standard class in a corridor next to the toilet, 1st class, I don't think so.No offer of any drinks or refreshments or a seat.. This was a birthday surprise, what a surprise.  I have emailed Virgin direct as well as our local MP expressing my disbelief of our so called public transport.  I now know why I travel so much in our private car.  Disgusting and UN-believeable.  I will up date this post if I receive a response from Virgin.Mr Branson, You need top take a look at your business end!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	Great Service. Good food	I travelled from Edinburgh to Aberdeen departing 1428 today. The service in first class was very good. The two guys on the trollies were attentive, polite and one in particular was very funny in a cheeky chappie type of way. All three members were constantly busy taking food orders, serving & tidying up.My chicken curry was very nice & my companion complimented his chicken wrap. Well done Virgin.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	5
2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	Serious issue with the Virgin East Coast Website	Purchased tickets on 11th May for use on 29th May. 1 week before travel still no receipt or itinerary information even though the funds had left the account. Called Virgin and they told me no order exists, they also claim that no account exists against my email. I'm very sure the email was entered correctly but even still they must have other means of searching?We had no choice but to buy a second set of tickets in order for us to be able to travel. We've now used the second set of tickets but are having major problems getting a refund on the 1st set.Going around in circles with the telephone support people.  We've explained the situation 5 times already. The latest now is that the account has miraculously appeared and a reference (W63LJ49H) for the first set of tickets was located on their system.Now I'm being asked to provide proof of travel and evidence of the second tickets. Wasted far too much time on this already!The website is frustratingly slow and I'm very sure the issues above stem from a problem on the website. Why take the funds if they can't be linked to an order?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	Poor Customer Service and Raised Prices	As other reviews have said, the change from East Coast to Virgin has not been a good one.  The staff on the Inverness - Edinburgh line continue to be excellent but Virgin has raised prices, done away with the rewards scheme and ignores emails.  I am trying to get the Delay Repay compensation but, after numerous emails with no reply, I doubt that I will get it.  Why offer this scheme if you are not willing to honour it?Advance ticket prices have shot up and there seem to be less seats available.The Nectar points are paltry compared to the previous rewards scheme.I always made a point of travelling with East Coast- now I have no such loyalty and will travel with whoever is cheapest.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	Stick to Planes Forget Trains!	My teenage daughter in early December went to Newcastle via York from Scarborough for an One Day as a potential new student for Newcastle University in the academic year starting September 2016. A simple journey made a nightmare by Network Rail and 3rd party train company breaking down at an intersection of the main East Coast line outside Darlington.The resulted delay over 2 hours and missed connections at York on final leg of the journey back to Scarborough.Train Manager on Virgin East Coast Line excellent instructed daughter to claim for a refund and stamped her ticket accordingly. We then applied filling in forms requesting a refund expecting a delay of say 4 to 6 weeks. We heard from an agent based in Plymouth 4 weeks after filling form in that the scanned stamp on her ticket was eligible and to forward at our expense the original ticket. We did so immediately and now 12 weeks yes 3 months since first claiming a refund guess what no refund. Some 4 weeks after we sent the original tickets daughter received e mail ensuring payment within 10 days. I sent complaint letter 8 weeks ago no response! So forget any adverts hype and promises of a great service from VIRGIN its all media hype and reality the company is a disgrace and should stick to flying planes and forget trains. East Coast and the only real great train company since the railways went private GNER were fantastic on the EAST COAST now VIRGIN have a monopoly with WEST and EAST domination. I have now bought my daughter a car and told her forget VIRGIN trains on her future trips to Newcastle and home.I myself have also abandoned VIRGIN as my relatives live in KINGUSSIE south of Inverness and the cancellations and delays since VIRGIN took over the franchise have rocketed to an unacceptable level. Oh one thing not going down is prices most ADVANCE fares UP. So please send my daughter her refund - how would you feel - or is Sir Richard saving up for another tropical paradise island at the expense of his poor suffering customers!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	2
2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	The 'Great' Virgin Headless Chicken Act!!	I must be honest, that the levels of Customer Service (if that's what you laughingly call it) during the chaos of the evening of 5 December, 2015 @ approximately 18:00 at Waverley Station Edinburgh, were the absolute worst that I've ever encounted and showed me that during an emergency, Virgin Rail has no back up plan or protocols to handle extreme situations. My daughter was booked into 1st Class on the 18:41 from Edinburgh to Newcastle. I appreciate the weather was extreme and the situation rapidly spiraled out of control. We checked your website for updates as we were well aware of flooding etc in the Borders & Northumberland. Your Website indicated a detour via Carlisle which although was reassuring we thought a bit odd, due to flooding in Cumbria?! We stood with hundreds of other anxious passengers on the main Waverley concourse tracking the 18:41 train as it moved towards its departure time. All it showed was 'On Time' but no platform? As the minutes ticked by and arrival time ticked on, we realized with no updates or reliable information the 18:41 was either cancelled or going no where fast, for obvious reasons. Trying to make sense of PA announcements in that crowd was impossible. We could only see 'Scotrail'Staff reassuring their passengers but where were Virgin Staff, conspicuous by their absence?! The Waverley Information counter was 80 + persons deep. Your website was not updating, I tried Twitter and received supercilious, snarky Tweets from yourselves which did nothing to reassure us. Eventually a woman in a Virgin windbreaker casually informed us that Buses / Coaches were waiting on the Market Street side of Waverley, this triggered a mad scramble up escalators & stairs: (the elderly, infirm & blind took their chances) and as we arrived at the Market Street exit, a bemused BR Policeman informed us there were no Buses / Coaches! Still no Virgin staff to advise or re-assure. Another mad scramble back to the Virgin Ticket Office which was bursting to the rafters. 2 maybe 3 staff trying to advise us, your Passengers. Again no announcements, no staff coming out to speak etc. Hundreds in the queue.  By 19:12:40 (can supply a photo) the 18:41 train was still on the Board as 'Delayed' No it wasn't, it was 'Cancelled' but still no word from Virgin, just hundreds of your passengers trying to glean information and separate the rumors from fact. It became apparent that the single man (can supply a photo) in your Virgin Ticket Office, who despite over whelming odds, was dolling out Taxi Vouchers, to get folk home to Newcastle. Eventually I got my daughter into a party of 4 other ladies all bound for Newcastle, eventually leaving on a highly hazardous road journey to Newcastle Central. I repeat - I fully understand that the weather played havoc with Train departures. I fully appreciate it had been raining for 2 days none stop. I do not appreciate the lack of reliable, reassuring information from Virgin Rail. You have glossy, glitzy and funky PR and TV ads, but when the wet & brown smelly stuff hits the fan, your staff, such as those I could see, had not a clue how to deal with agitated & anxious passengers stranded in Waverley. Shame on you Virgin Rail! Your planning & protocols are abysmal!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	Extreme Irritation at VTEC	On the 21st September 2015, I travelled on VIrgin Train East Coast to Edinburgh. Due to a damaged rail tracks, our train was delayed for over two hours. On returning to London, I completed and posted the Delay/Repay form and then I waited for Virgin Trains East Coast to get back to me. And boy, did I wait.6 weeks later, I still hadn't heard anything from VTEC. I called their Customer Relations department, who then, apologised profusely and informed that my refund was in the post. Well you can imagine my annoyance, when the letter arrived and instead of VTEC sending me the cheque that I requested, they enclosed Rail Travel Vouchers, stating that they would love to see me back on their trains again soon.I then had to post the Rail Vouchers back and after waiting another 3 weeks and hearing nothing from them, I called VTEC Customer Relations once again and was informed that I would not be receiving my cheque until the New Year.I think for once, I was absolutely speechless.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	2
2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	Shambles total shambles	Why oh why Virgin, delayed trains, terrible services, and worse coffee.Customer service is a joke, in fact its worse than a joke, as they just do not reply, if they do its with a stupid question, such as what time did the train depart that was cancelled!!!March you off onto a bus, the oldest bus they can find, kindly give you a bottle of water, but the big sign says NO DRINKS!! miserable bus driver, who did not even tell you where you were.Try making a claim, forget it they run you around in circles, try this e mail, no reply, try this one, no reply, oh well maybe try this, no reply again.Avoid them at all cost!! no chance we have to use them, and they know it that is why they treat us like they do.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	Evil, greedy, shameless company	"Eastcoast was never a great train company, but I can say this is nothing compared to how they are when they privatise. Their whole aim is to con money out of ordinary people and NOTHING ELSE. The trains are always delayed, I myself was on 5 delayed trains last week, one 45 mins, two 20 mins, one 30 min, and one 10 mins delayed. It's beyond awful. The trains are often over crowded, they constantly ""lose"" the bookings which wipes the system and those who have booked seats are left standing. They have a delay repay system which they do not, I repeat, they do not stick to!!! It's been over a month and I still haven't received several refunds I applied for. They also lie about how long the train has been delayed for and simply deny you any repay. That's right, the train has to be over 30 mins delayed to actually receive a fraction of the refund. If you look at the FB page there are hundreds of people who haven't received refunds either. If you are lucky enough to get a refund, you'll realise this is given in ""travel vouchers"" so you have to spend more money with their company. You're not allowed to use them on advance tickets so you have to spend them on a ticket at the station, which is obviously going to cost more and make them more money. They also increase the price of tickets when you use a rail card on their website, so that you aren't saving money. They really are a ruthless, money grabbing company, avoid at all costs unless you want a horrible, overpriced journey."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	Dreadful first class experience	Travelled first class from Edinburgh to Newcastle today, never again.  Great staff on board the train but the food is disgusting, first a cup of lukewarm tea then a blt sandwich made with a piece of bacon which was more fat than meat and tomato paste, I threw it away.  Next a piece of stale coffee/chocolate cake which tasted of neither, the only fruit selection was a banana so I ended up with a small packet of crisps and a can of cola.  Called into the first class lounge at Newcastle, there was no coffee and not a biscuit in sight so that was a waste of time.  Really disgraceful, nothing like a first class service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	2
2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	VERY POOR	Having travelled twice in the last fortnight all I can say is Virgin needs to sort  out Major problems.Two trips from Edinburgh to Newcastle, the first with my wife,the second with ex colleagues. My wife and I boarded the first class carriage at Newcastle and found our seat, the table was covered with dirty cups etc from a previous passenger. Eventually it was cleared and we were offered a cup of luke warm coffee and a snack which we refused because it just looked so unappetising. Coming back was a different experience 3 days later on a Cross Country train with attentive friendly staff a clean carriage hot freshly made coffee and a good quality sandwich.A week later travelling with 3 colleagues again first class boarding at Newcastle we  were told that there was limited food only 3 very poor quality croissants almost thrown at us amongst the 4 of us and more luke warm coffee served with bad grace.On the way back after enjoying a couple of shows and lunch in Edinburgh  we as usual called into M&S to buy a couple of beers for the train as we always have for the last 10+ years. We were then confronted by quite aggressive staff as we went to the platform. Virgin had declared it a dry train, we had no prior notification and were forced to just dump our purchases or we would not be allowed to board. I could possibly understand this if we were boarding a train full of football supporters, but 4, 60 year old's travelling so called first class, a very third class service with huge issues of training staff to interact correctly with customers. Needless to say say the cheap white bread , mousetrap cheese sandwich was not enjoyed.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	Treated Like Criminals in First Class By Virgin East Coast Trains !	Travelling from Edinburgh to Newcastle on Sunday 19th July 2015 at 18:30 PM .... My very First experience First class and terribly Excitement to have been lucky to travel First Class a First ever, Destroyed by Virgin Trains Staff !!!  My Chinese Friend and I travelled first class  after he as a pleasant surprise purchased the tickets as a treat it was very first time going first class and I was excited and somewhat shocked...both of us entered 'M' carriage for first class and saw a man checking out our seating and standing on our seat placing something on the baggage area above, then made a rude comment about he not affording to go first class etc...then leaving. This mature middle plus aged man was in civilian clothing, white and fat etc... Then when the Virgin Trains  ticket man came along he treated us especially me like a criminal ! No one else was treated like this it was embarrassing and humiliating in-front of other passengers who looked as if they were using upgraded tickets too.  The Ticket man treated me as if I did not belong in First class seating and despite my Chinese friend giving him all the tickets and purchasing evidence needed he purchased the ticket man was very very rude to us!  Further when the female came with food again we were treated as second class citizens and given not what we politely requested, and treated as we should be lucky to be there.!I am a great supporter of Mr Brandson and Virgin Trains for which I have used many times before (not first class) But this behaviour was disgraceful indeed and All those in the Chinese community and myself a Gay Middle aged man will think very carefully about travelling Virgin Trains ever again. Despite having pictures of us sitting in First class for evidence Date and times... Their so called 'Customer Relations' at Virgin Trains are sitting on this appalling Incident, and Doing Nothing about it!  Prejudice and Discrimination Clearly exists at Virgin Trains East Coast !	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1

I always used to be able to buy train tickets to the north from london within a week. They must have much reduced the number of cheap tickets that they now sell, as prices of 'cheap tickets' appear to have doubled. I guess that this is a long journey toward tickets that are 4 times higher (like the west coast mainline).

2017-01-11T15:11:40Z	Deception	On the 12/05/2015 about 12.45, I was traveling to London on an east coast Virgin Train from Doncaster. I decided to order a coffee, After asking the trolly guy for a coffee (it stated “Azera Barista style”), I suddenly remembered that these days (again) you need to specify that “I require a real coffee”. This I did, he said I don’t know I only have this (waving an already opened sachet in front of me). I repeated that I do not want anything like Nescafe instant rubbish. He repeated “that he only had this”. As he had already opened the sachet I decided to go ahead with the purchase. £2.35 later I had the coffee? After I had finished adding milk, sugar and replacing the lid, I had a sip, it was awful. I then noticed on the side of the cup Nescafe Azera Instant. I then realised that I had been deceived. The so called Barista had long gone.As a result of this, I will think very carefully before using Virgin Trains again.Update, I did receive a £5- rail voucher in June. I have to say, that is measly compensation for deception!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	They refuse to give any refunds for Covid-19	They refuse to give any refunds for trips canceled because of Government restrictions on travel due to Covid-19.  We tried to re-book 3 times and each time the governments of both France and the UK have banned us from traveling in and out of their countries and yet Eurostar continues to keep our money!  EVERY other airline and train company has given us our money back.  Eurostar STILL refuses!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	I had the worst eurostar experience…	I had the worst eurostar experience yesterday 23 October 2020, afternoon train. It is been few weeks/months that eurostar is struggling with covid, constantly cancelling bookings. Those cancellated booking are free of charge replacement. But those ticket always disappear from the eurostar app. So it is difficult to track ticket whose has been cancelled. So you always have to go back to your booking emails, if you still have them. It is OK if you one ticket cancelled but when you have 10 return tickets it is really painful and not clear. In addition, you cannot change them on the app as from time to time it does not work. So as I could not change my ticket I went to eurostar yesterday beforr departure as i have done it several times before, I asked someone to change my ticket to the next departure. But, when I arrived they had no one from eurostar able to change my cancelled tickets due to a reduction of staf in the station. But had 3 people there to say 'hi' to people!? Find the error !The staf there was berly speaking French. Feel really offended that the line manager present there expected me to speak with me in  flamish to explain the current issue.  Feel a bit of racism! She did not want to help me at all.Later on, an other lady arrived, a bit late 15minutes before departure. She was almost having an heart attack when the eurostar line manager told her she cannot get in. The line manage and her colleague have not moved a fingers in order to help this poor lady while having an shorten breath. She would have let her die. It is unbelievable how eurostar is dealing with covid issue. It is the worst experience I have ever had. How people can be that unrespectful?Eurostar should review they staf and find helpful staf, willing to help passengers in this diffucult time and not make the passanger life even more diffucult. Next time I will travel by flight.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Thieves	I was notified less that 24 hours before my departure that my return ticket was cancelled. With both reduced Eurostar service and current Sncf Covid schedules there is just no trains that connects on time anymore for my journey back. That meant that if I were to take the inbound journey I would end up stranded in France. The only option I had left with was to change my journey from Strasbourg-London via Lille instead of Paris. Eurostar refused to change this leg of the journey for me despite the inconvenience they caused. They told me the only option I had was to get the voucher and rebook the entire journey back. But the entire journey back including changing the Sncf trains last minute would have cost us 2.5x the price of our original tickets. No compensation, no help, just a stressful two hours on the phone arguing with them to end up with nothing. Holidays cancelled. Oh and yes now I need to wait 28 days to be able to use up my voucher. Thieves.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	They will not refund my money	"They will not refund my money.  THey claim they have sent a refund, but my bank tells me such a ""refund"" has not reached them after 6 months.  Maybe they sent it ""Burro Express"", but it is starting to look more and more like they just want to keep my money and keep on making excuses."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Your website is such a bad experience	"Your website is such a bad experience! Your customer service is hard to reach. Problem 1 - back in June I was coming back from France to the UK and my tickets were canceled and your website wouldn't let me change my ticket so I had to buy a new one. I sent you an email asking for a refund and I still didn't get a reply. Can someone reply to me and pay me back for this please it has been months. Problem 2: I have a trip to the UK next week and my train both ways was canceled, I was told to change my train free of charge but when I go to manage my booking all the options are paid. I am being asked to pay £105 for changing my trains. I now tried several times to log in and log out from my account, once I saw the options to be free (which is how it should be) so I selected the options and pressed a button to change my ticket, but guess what the Eurostar website decided to crash. It's saying ""we are almost there"" for the past 15 minutes. So as a result I still did not manage to change my tickets. I am posting here and on Twitter in a hope to get a response."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Update - Gift voucher refusal to extend expiry date	I was initially very disappointed to find that eurostar were not prepared to extend the expiry date on vouchers bought as a gift. The person had not been able to use them due to the covid situation as they are in the vulnerable category. Their initial response was to say all vouchers are only valid for 12 months. However after I emailed expressing my disappointment and also posted a negative review on here they replied promptly. They apologised for the first email and have now extended the vouchers until Sept next year.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Horrible & Stressful Journey, I’ll never EuroStar again!	Horrible customer service, rude train staff and uncomfortable journey. They cancelled and rebooked our journey multiple times, costing us hundreds of pounds, saying we had to pay again for each rebooking. In the end, the trains they booked were so messed up that we arrived from Amsterdam to Brussels AFTER our train from Brussels to London left. Thus, missing our ride back home. We spent so much extra money trying to get back to the UK. And, although I deeply support and understand the current COVID19 sensitivity and the required guidelines, I suffer from severe eczema on my face, which makes me medically exempt from face masks. I still do my best to put up with the pain and wear a face mask for as many hours as I can.  Wearing one for a prolonged amount of time causes bleeding and a lot of pain. After the first 2 hours of the journey, my skin needed a break, but when I informed the attendants, they told me unless I had a medical report from a hospital, I wasn’t allowed to take it off. UK laws strictly prohibit anyone from asking for a medical report to prove you are exempt from face masks due to a medical disability, which can be seen on the government website. However, Eurostar is clearly exempt from government guidelines. I felt really embarrassed trying to explain my health condition, which feels so private, and the UK guidelines to an attendant while the whole carriage listened.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Eurotrash!	Had tickets booked from Paris to London. Five days before we were due to travel, we got a message saying our train had been cancelled, but we would be issued with a voucher, which we could offset against future travel.If a service provider fails to provided the service which has been contractually agreed, without offering a valid reason, then they are in breach of contract. Eurostar's reson was 'Covid-19 restrictions'. At the time, the restrictions were no different to when we made our outward journey so this was nonsense. In any case, if they don't provide the service, they are legally obliged to make a full refund.Anyway, to continue. Although our train was cancelled, they had another one available, for which we could book tickets at almost 4 X the cost of the original ones. You might ask why they didn't simply offer us travel on that train using our original tickets, if seats were available. We wondered that too and emailed Eurostar, but three days later, there is still no reply.Effectively, Eurostar abandoned its customers in a foreign country and offered not a jot of support, simply asking for more money. Bearing in mind the current situation, I would put this on the same level as profiteering in wartime. Their behaviour is absolutely despicable.Despite the inconvenience and added time, I will be driving to Europe in future, rather than travelling with this bunch of crooks	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Lost A Loyal Customer	I've staying in travelled many times with Eurostar, and was generally happy with them, so was expecting a reasonable approach during the Covid times.

2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Eurostar trying to profit from quarantines	In the middle of recently announced quarantines, Eurostar has removed its free exchange option, in that a fee applies for any change within 14 days. I just tried to change my ticket for one where the change fee was minimal. I had to update my payment details first. Within a few minutes, all change options are now £75! Being held over a barrel, shocking behaviour	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Taking advantage of Covid to rip off customers	No answer from customer service Didn't appreciate they have used Covid-19 and travel restrictions to increase their prices and force people to pay double to travel back. Also never book another train ticket on Eurostar. They offer the bookings but won't take responsibility if the train is late and you miss your connection ( and they don't plan enough time between connections).	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

No support, no help, cant change destination (which may have helped with date change), dates for next year unavaliable.Legitimate scam.

2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Over 4 months a still no refund	Like many others we have been trying for over four months to claim a refund for a cancelled train. They try to fob you off with a voucher despite the fact they are legally obliged to give refunds. Despite repeated emails we have just received one holding reply over three months ago. All the other train companies we booked for our holiday have sent prompt refunds. There is no excuse for this appalling lack of service. It seems they are trying to minimise the number of refunds paid.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-08-17T20:13:48Z	Poor Customer Service	We had made plans to travel from Australia in August 2020. A much-anticipated part of our trip was to be Eurostar from Paris to London. Due to COVID 19, our travel plans were cancelled due to restrictions placed on travel by the Australian, French & British Governments. Every other service provider, from airlines to accommodation to attractions have given us refunds. Eurostar has offered a voucher valid for 12 months. It is obvious that no-one reads my emails or they would understand our trip is cancelled, not postponed. Eurostar, contrary to their emails, DO NOT CARE. Would I recommend Eurostar? Never. Would give them less than one start if possible.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Now with the advice of 13 August on travel to France the balance of the travel is ‘no refund - no e-voucher’. And of course it is impossible to actually talk to someone at Eurostar UK. Will be avoiding them in future as a ticket provider. SNCF however have given full refunds by simple web application on all train travel in France if unable to travel due to covid / government restrictions.Considering you can buy tickets from London to Paris / Belgium / Amsterdam etc via SNCF I know where I will go next time if I need to travel via train.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-08-17T20:13:48Z	Incompetent or dishonest?	"Incompetent or dishonest management is the only way to explain the delay that keeps growing by 30 mins every 15 mins due to ""**A** cancellation earlier that day"". You own the entire infrastructure - you know exactly how many cars come through each minute and on what train they're booked and (unlike in Folkestone) it's not possible to queue jump in Calais - how you can't plan effectively around such shatteringly detailed data beggars belief."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-08-17T20:13:48Z	Refused to refund!	Refused to refund!Now that Belgium is off the travel list any train going through that station you would have to self-isolate. I already had one train cancelled and had to rebook, putting hours on my journey time to due to a change over in Belgium. They clearly do not want future custom as not offering a refund only e-voucher (because we can all afford to go on massive holidays every year!). I would happily pay a charge or only get a partial refund but they were having none of it. I am going to left with a useless voucher that I will never use. Just avoid Eurostar, the headache is not worth it.UPDATEAfter 4 days I finally got a phone call from a manager who just did not care at all that the vouchers would be useless to me. It is not often I slam the phone down on someone but  in this case I did. It was like talking to a robot.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-08-17T20:13:48Z	OK once you're on the train. Check-in unpleasant. Room for improvement.	One member of gate staff at London was a bit rude with a passive-aggressive “Can I help you?!” bellowed at me as I struggled to retrieve my passport within the requisite 15 seconds, but apart from her I found the staff to be fairly helpful.It’s a shame the same cannot be said for the Border Control staff, whom I found quite rude and arrogant, with an attitude that suggests they’re somehow doing you a favour by letting you proceed beyond their little glass cubicle after waiting in a long, snaking queue with little regard for social distancing for 20 minutes because they can only be bothered to put two staff on, despite knowing well in advance the number of passengers to expect.) However, I do understand there’s probably not much Eurostar can do about this.The journey itself was pleasant, smooth and quick through to Lille and back to London. The tickets are quite pricey, but fairly reasonable considering the trains can only run at a limited capacity at the moment.It was a similar experience on the way back, with two polite and helpful Eurostar staff on arrival at the terminal, an extremely rude and shouty English border control woman, a very polite and friendly one and a really rude and an arrogant French cop.Note that you have to bring your completed 'Passenger Locator Form' with you and present it at the UK Border Control cubicle, not on the train as I’d expected, something that is not made clear. (They may ask some questions, the answers to which you’ve already provided on the form but they don't read beyond your name and address.) It would have been helpful to have a sign advising passengers to have this ready, along with their travel documents. The Eurostar staff should have mentioned this on our arrival, before we proceeded to passport control.Social distancing isn’t really enforced at either end but there was an announcement reminding people to wear face coverings whilst onboard.One really irritating thing at Lille was the inability to easily find the train formation so you can be in the right place to board your carriage, and the lack of platform staff to assist. There were a couple of confusing electronic signs I found eventually but I still ended up getting on carriage 10 instead 4. It was fairly empty so I stayed there for entire journey.Another annoying thing was that the WiFi didn’t work on either the outbound or return journey, regardless of whether or not we were in a tunnel.And (unsurprisingly) the travelator and escalator didn't work at St. Pancras on return.I did find the Eurostar app pretty handy, however. It keeps details of your booking including tickets, seat reservations etc.All in all I was happy with the service provided by Eurostar but there is certainly room for improvement. And don’t expect check-in to be a pleasant experience. Be prepared to queue for ages and be treated with utter contempt, like you’re a total inconvenience by the border and security people. Nice once you’re on the train though.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3

2020-08-17T20:13:48Z	Tried to refuse refund for cancellation	Eurostar sent me an e-mail informing me my train had been cancelled. The options they gave me were either a voucher or re-booking, no mention of a refund as I was legally entitled. I sent Eurostar an e-mail requesting a refund, they gave me the same options essentially no refund. When I sent my second e-mail explaining I am legally entitled to a refund as my train was cancelled I was eventually issued a refund. Why couldn’t they simply offer me the refund option in the first place? I would have considered taking a voucher if they were honest from the outset. After their deceptive e-mail I wanted my money back and will avoid Eurostar in the future.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-08-17T20:13:48Z	The company wants you to keep…	The company wants you to keep travelling during the COVID-19 pandemics. No care for health and safety of the passengers!Awful experience with Eurostar. We have booked tickets and stay in Paris for between 19-22 March but travel was impossible due to COVID-19 restrictions imposed by France (they closed the border on 20 March).Eurostar are reluctant to issue us a refund as the train actually left for France on 19th (no one cares that we would struggle to return on the 22nd) - they have issued a voucher for travel in the next 12 months (they actually send us c 30 emails with different vouchers as their internal systems are flawed). It is a disgrace how the company is playing on COVID-19! They have never delivered their part of contract and have deprived us from use of the money.Also, in order not to issue a refund they are pushing us to travel in this uncertain times putting our health at risk. It`s a disgrace!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-08-17T20:13:48Z	Really good experience getting a refund…	Really good experience getting a refund for eurostar tickets booked in April - and therefore cancelled train due to Covid. I applied for a refunds via email - didnt hear anything in email - but 2 weeks ago I phoned them direct, and was dealt with very politely and helpfully, and my refund is now back with me. I think if you wait for email then you may have a long wait, so worth phoning if you need the money back now.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5
2020-08-17T20:13:48Z	Best way to get to Southern France.	I have travelled to France with Eurostar for 6 years and always had excellent service. The train from Ashford to Marseille is particularly good for us with comfortable carriages and helpful staff. My only criticism is the requirement to get off at Lille, pass through customs and re-board. I am sure that, with a little more planning this could be made more efficient.This year I received an email on 24th June telling me that all services to the South of France are cancelled for both 2020 and 2021. I can understand cancelling 2020 due to covid but not 2021.Unlike other reviewers I received my refund within 2 days (26th June).	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4
2020-08-17T20:13:48Z	Buyer beware	Rather unbelievable attempts to avoid refunding for cancelled service. You email requesting a refund and rejecting vouchers, and get a standard response saying how pleased they are to offer you a voucher, completely ignoring the request. They (now) have a website stating the right to a refund,  but you cant use the link provided  with your booking reference: the ticket number is needed and this is provided only through the e-tickets in your account which once the train is cancelled don't have any ticket numbers!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-08-17T20:13:48Z	Taking advantage on customers.....	I am SO disappointed of this company. Notwithstanding that their prices are already insanely high in normal time, I had my train cancelled three days before departure which allows me no solution apart cancelling my whole journey. After staying on the phone for a two hours call, I have been told that if I wish to travel the day I was supposed to, I could for the ridiculous price of £300 in business.... WHAT A JOKE ! I am done with them, they will send me a refund in the next following days (no way for me to take a voucher, it is the last time I am using their services....). Because of their lack of empathy and their need of profit, I will miss the marriage of my sister this week end, for which I am (supposedly) witness. The moral cost of this is priceless, but at least I will make sure to invest in a car in UK for my future trips in North France, or the bus !	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-08-17T20:13:48Z	Rest of the below bad reviews say it all! NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH	Been waiting for a full refund since April due to Covid-19/train cancelled although we're legally entitled to it under CIV rules when they cancel my train.To date despite multiple calls (hour long wait each time) I've not been able to speak to anyone.Then I received an email suggesting that my email address was different from the one used for booking (UTTER NONSENSE!!), and that I would need to resubmit the online form. This is a blatant delaying tactic from them; interestingly it seems like fellow reviewers here also had a similar experience.The way Eurostar have dealt with this is appalling.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-08-17T20:13:48Z	Sadly another good company turns terrible	Sadly another casualty of utter mis-managment.  Eurostar used to be good, I'm a regular traveller (or was before the pandemic) but their service has gone completely down the toilet in recent years, just awful. Always late, dreadful new trains, expensive tickets, bad food, awful wi-fi that never works etc etc...   Anyway, had a train book for June 2020 - middle of lockdown - so clearly couldn't travel.  It's utter lies on their website that they say they will contact you - they don't and never will.  I emailed them 5 times and NEVER got a reply (still to this day!), phoned many times and usually got cut off after waiting an hour or so.  Eventually got hold of someone a week before the travel date and was told the train will likely be cancelled, but they can't say yet so wouldn't refund me but offered vouchers.  I wanted a refund, so they said call back the following week.  I did, took forever again to get through and was told they don't know again blah blah excuses excuses so when I said 'ok, I'll turn up tomorrow at St Pancras and expect my money if you cancel' he said 'hang on - oh it's just been cancelled, so yes you can have a refund'.  Just total lies, the chances of it being cancelled while I was on the phone is just rubbish.  Anyway, I agreed and took the refund - which of course then never happened.  I had to make 3 further calls over the following weeks and was told 'we're looking in it' each time, fob off after fob off.  On the last call I advised them I was telling our bank to retrieve the money directly from them.  The next day they transferred the money to our account.  Awful company.** NEW NOTE - decided actually to post a comment made to me my a good Eurostar staff member who wanted to speak out.  Their new trains are terrible for the tracks they told me, causing them damage (ie costing more in repair at some point).  Eurostar also know the 'new' trains make people (including staff) feel sick, unlike the old style trains.  Interestingly, they told me that some years ago, the person in charge at the time of the deal with Seimens to build the 'new' trains has since left Eurostar and now works for Seimens.  Hmmm, cough cough, defintely all, ahem, above board...	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-08-17T20:13:48Z	Very Poor Response	Yesterday, we had the  latest in a series of hopeless responses from Eurostar to our cancelled journeys (in March 2020). These were 3 blank emails from 'Eurostar eVouchers', without any content or attachments.  Earlier repeated e mails suggested my e mail address was different to the one used when booking (which was nonsense) and previous to that e mails enclosing random incorrect vouchers which were subsequently withdrawn. Either these are delaying tactics or the team involved are incompetent.  Furthermore, they don't respond to e mails. The pandemic may be resulting in their staff being overwhelmed but they are creating further problems for themselves by sending out inept messages.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-08-17T20:13:48Z	Another terrible review	Another terrible review. They sell tickets for trains that don't exist!

2020-08-17T20:13:48Z	Return passengers made to pay 200 pounds	This company contacted 4 days before travelling, said my train was cancelled but I could pay more than 200 pounds extra to travel on the day planned. I have an elderly partially sighted parent in the UK, a husband in France and I am unable to travel back without paying treble the price. I will be sleeping on the street for 3 nights til they can get me back on the price I paid, which is 4 days away.So Eurostar cancels,trains are still travelling but you have to pay 200 pounds to get back. In addition, they are offering evouchers, not refunds, and telling passengers they will have to pay any difference when passengers use them. I would never book with this company again. These are the facts. Make your own mind up.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-06-25T13:37:37Z	have always made me feel like a valued customer	Unfortunately, I had to cancel 3 trips between Paris and London between March and June due to the global pandemic. Eurostar offered me travel vouchers for the first 2 trips and refunded me for the 3rd (because I had only bought cancellation protection for the 3rd trip). The refund came to me within 7 days and it took just over 3 months for the vouchers to come through. This was quite a long time for the vouchers, but I never doubted that they would eventually come through and I was not disappointed. Over that 3-month period, Eurostar were great at continuing to update me about the status of the vouchers, which I really appreciate because it let me know that they hadn't forgotten or gone back on their word. Just like any transport company, Eurostar can make logistical errors, but in my experience, they have always corrected their errors by offering compensation and have always made me feel like a valued customer. Even when I have made my own logistical errors in the past, the staff have always been quick and keen to help me find a solution in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5
2020-06-25T13:37:37Z	A greedy company.	Eurostar is absolutely the worst company!  They refuse to refund ticket prices due to the pandemic.  My flight to London from the U.S. was cancelled.  Tourists were not allowed to enter the UK.  France closed its borders to tourists.  My Airbnb in Paris was cancelled. So even though I could not take the Eurostar train to Paris, Eurostar wants to keep my money and instead offered me a worthless voucher that I had to use by Sept. 1 and travel by May 23, 2021.  As if we all know when the pandemic will subside and it will be safe to travel by then.  I am 73 years old and need to be safe.  Eurostar is stealing money and not providing a service. When all other modes of transport and hotels are refunding ticket prices due to COVID-19, Eurostar stands out as a greedy dishonest company.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-25T13:37:37Z	Refund policy is bad	Gave me only the option of an evoucher when I first requested a refund when my train was cancelled. Nothing came through for three months. Contacted them again for a refund - they said they could only give an evoucher. I’m never using them if I can avoid it. Absolute cons.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-25T13:37:37Z	WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! FULL REFUND NOT GIVEN!	I had a trip booked in May, firstly they refused to give me a refund until the date of travel. I asked whether I would get a full refund and I was told yes if my train didn't run. Train didn't run of course because of covid 19. Rang up, asked for a refund and was not given a full refund only partial. Apparently fees cannot be refunded but I haven't been provided with a service. I am £140 out of pocket! Wrote a complaint over a month ago and not had a reply. Awful, awfuk service and looking at all recent reviews, it looks like I'm not the only one! WILL NEVER BOOK WITH EUROSTAR AGAIN, RATHER FLY!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-06-25T13:37:37Z	Had to cancel our trip to Paris 1 day…	Had to cancel our trip to Paris 1 day before France officially went into lock down.  Eurostar issued a 1 year e voucher for travel up to march 2021.  Under normal circumstances I would be fine with that but we live in the USA and there is no chance we will be back before that time frame, we even asked for an extension until the end of 2021, the answer was still no!  ALL other European service providers refunded our money without question so what is the problem with Eurostar?Easy Jet from now on!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-25T13:37:37Z	Mistaken evouchers	I have asked for e vouchers not because I cannot travel on these dates but because you have insisted in asking travellers to postpone their trip to avoid overbookings and train station congestion, due to post Covid-19. I have received e vouchers which are half the price of my tickets.... That's totally unfair above all as I had to change already once my tickets in March due to Covid-19 at MY expenses. I ask Eurostar to issue vouchers corresponding to the original amounts. Completely surrealistic..........	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-25T13:37:37Z	Travel cancelled in March	Travel cancelled in March. Told via website I could get a voucher. Still not received. Cancelled TGV got a full refund in 3 days. Next time easyJet to Paris	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-25T13:37:37Z	DISHONEST BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!	I booked with Rail Europe for a Eurostar train in April to go to Paris. The lockdown restrictions in the UK and in France meant non-essential journeys were not to be taken. So I did not attempt to go to France and thought a company like Eurostar would refund my tickets.I am being offered vouchers! I paid in real money but the refund is not in real money. I feel I’m being ripped off!Will I be able to travel in 2021? Will there still be restrictions on travelling in 2021? Will COVID-19 still be killing people? Will we be vaccinated?Eurostar cannot answer those questions but feel entitled to hang on to customers’ money! That’s dishonest!I tried to get my money refunded by Rail Europe but was told they cannot do that because Eurostar does not have a refund policy.I contact Eurostar and am told that I must get the refund from Rail Europe. This is not a way to treat customers. Eurostar, change your refund policy! Be honest! Give back the money to your customers!Honest companies like the SNCF and First Great Western refunded me without a single problem. They did what was normal. What’s stopping you?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-25T13:37:37Z	Avoid if you can!	Avoid if you can!I'm in the same camp as those who had booked with Eurostar and lockdown restrictions meant that travelling was no longer an option. Vouchers are a complete waste of time as family and job circumstances meant that re-booking is impossible. Other companies are able to do the decent thing and be sympathetic to the hardships of all families impacted by the pandemic. Refunding quickly and openly would actually build up customer trust and confidence for future and repeat business. But sadly their policies is set in way to frustrate and skewed in their favour. At a time where we all need to show a little kindness, I feel it's sorely lacking with this company. I for one will never want to deal with Eurostar again. Don't forget, the pandemic will come and go. But a bad customer experience, lasts a lifetime. Signed up to Trust Pilot to warn others.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-25T13:37:37Z	To give some balance	We'd booked on the direct service to the South of France, travelling out in the first week of June. Having read reviews and stories on here and elsewhere, I was expecting some difficulty, even if the service was cancelled.  However, on June 2nd, I received a text to confirm that our train had been cancelled and giving a link to 'rearrange the trip'.  Following that link, I was given the option for e-vouchers or a refund, which I chose.  I was emailed the following day to confirm the request and the money was refunded to my credit card with 3 working days.  Very relieved that this has been straightforward.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5
2020-06-25T13:37:37Z	No refunds even though we are in lockdown	It's really annoying that despite making a booking in 2019 for travel in June, Eurostar will only offer gift voucher not a refund even though UK and France are in lock down.I don't think this is acceptable but they say 'take it or leave it'.Their mentality is the train is running so even though we are suppose to be in lockdown we aren't giving refunds.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-25T13:37:37Z	Eurostar vouchers	I was given two Eurostar vouchers as a gift last year to be used to pay for one hotel and train break. Only when booking did I find that you can only use one voucher per trip. You cant contact Eurostar but only acompany called Voucher Express who looked into it but nothing could be done to let me use other vouchers. I thought I would use the remaining voucher this year but couldn't book anything on Eurostar due to the travel restrictions. I  ontacted voucher express to ask fora voucher extension to use next year  They looked into it but it wasnt possible. They just administer the vouchers but dont set the terms and conditions. Eurostar do.  So that voucher has gone to waste. Save your money and give someone cash instead of buying vouchers for Eurostar. It's a shame as travelling with Eurostar is good	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	2

2020-06-25T13:37:37Z	Amazing customer service (phone operator UK)	This is a review for their customer service. I phoned them for a coronavirus travel advice related question, and they answered straight away. As regulations change by the day and border control policies aren't in their hands, as I suspected, they didn't have the answers I was looking for (turns out not even the French consulate had them). HOWEVER I spoke to the lovely Harmanna who really put everything she had into researching the right answer for me and showed what was easily the most patient and kind response to an impossible customer question a phone line has ever heard. Thoroughly impressed!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5

'Complete lack of customer engagement.Whilst I acknowledge the current covid-19 situation, the company have been grossly negligent when it comes to customer engagement and very poor information when it comes to refunds for tickets/travel.I myself have had to issue County Court proceedings in order to obtain a refund and despite promises of payment this has so far not happened.Even emailing their customer services directors etc you get nowhere and are ignored.I can only advise you to avoid this company when travel restrictions are lifted.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Was promised by a Customer Service Manager she would personally sort it for me and I've never heard from her since! I've called and was put on hold by an agent and after 30mins I gave up.

2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Issues with refunds & vouchers over Covid19 travel	Trip to Paris in May was cancelled due to Covid 19. Train also cancelled. Eurostar will not refund and only willing to provide a very restrictive voucher.After lots of emails, a longer voucher for the next 12 months now provided.I am dissapointed it took so much effort to get to that point. Fingers crossed for next time i travel!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Untrustworthy	Withholding any refund or exchange voucher due to Covid-19. Untrustworthy. We’ve been waiting months and no action. Avoid	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Terrible seating, though still slightly more comfortable than airplanes	The service isn't what it used to be. Client service refuse to take responsibility for Eurostar's own errors. Still 3 stars because I have great memories of many years ago. Travelling by train remains more comfortable than taking the plane. Despite the terrible new seats that give me a back-ache every time I travel.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Refund scam	Our 12:58 train on 23 May (today) to Brussels from St Pancras has been cancelled. The return train this Thursday looks to be running. I wrote to Eurostar to ask whether, as we can’t get to Brussels (because you’ve cancelled it PLUS we would not be permitted into Belgium as this is non-essential travel for us), we are entitled to a refund for the inbound train as well as the outbound? Useless answer was received from them which comprised of some meaningless pre-approved sentences, probably generated by a computer. Regardless, I decided to at least make my claim for the cancelled outbound train while I decided what to do with the inbound- I started this yesterday and am still trying today - the refund page just times out. My broadband speed is excellent and I have also downloaded Chrome in case Safari is the problem.  I do not believe the refund page being down is a coincidence and I will be contacting the media right now.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Accepted Eurostar e-vouchers as getting…	Accepted Eurostar e-vouchers as getting so stressed with trying to claim refund. Return journey St Pancreas to Paris two people amount was £176. Received voucher refund for £159 as only refunded for the part of journey I could not use. Want part of the journey could we have used for £19 beside the fact their email to claim vouchers said refund would be for the booking fee.  Ok not a massive amount of money but if this is happening to others it will be a massive amount of money for someone at Eurostar.  Like most of the other reviews disgusted with this Company	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	What should have been obvious is not always obvious!	Eurostar have decided to improve greatly the conditions behind their vouchers.  Whereas they were initially only prepared to give a voucher the booking for which had to be completed by 30 September 2020 and for which travel had to be completed by 31st March 2021 they now are issuing vouchers that allow booking up to 12 months from date of voucher issue.  Additionally your travel can be up to six months beyond the voucher validity date so all travel can take place up to some point in late 2021.  This is as it should have been in the first instance.  Three stars only though for all the unnecessary anxiety and time consuming trouble caused by this company's initial response.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Give us back our money	Like a lot of people here, I have been waiting months for a replacement e-voucher for a cancelled service weeks ago. Airbnb, National Express and others all issued refunds pretty much instantly. Can only assume that Eurostar are institutionally incompetent or just hold their customers in total contempt.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Disgusting and unfair	Disgusting and unfair.  How long is this situation going to be allowed to continue before the regulatory body or government step in. They should be ashamed of themselves.  I have been told my train is cancelled by a staff member however by email I am to check in 24 hours before departure. I could cancel my hotels etc. If they were honest and admitted the train is cancelled but they prefer to make a long term customer settle. I am going to the press.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	EuroStar rip-off	EuroStar? Someone needs to take them to court. They refuse to use the word CANCELLED for their trains that don't run. They think that lets them off the hook for refunds. WRONG. A train that doesn't run is CANCELLED and as such a refund is a legal necessity. Bullying passengers into accepting unusable alternative vouchers is another of their scams. DON'T accept this. After the first FREE voucher exchange you will pay normal prohibitive penalties for a second change. You will also pay the new price mark-up for a ticket. Currently that's more than a 100% increase. Never again, I hear you say. Cheaper to fly, or drive. Driving used to be fun. CEO needs to stand tall and be fair	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Eurostar are Appalling	Eurostar are appalling. They are treating customers with contempt and breaking the law with their lack of action in response to refunds. I have been waiting since calling in mid-March to refund a family trip over Easter. There has been no response to recent emails. I feel they are actual thieves, they are agents for SNCF travel as part of our trip, SNCF emailed to say a refund for that part could be claimed from the agent, which is Eurostar who of course have done nothing. I have been a regular customer for years, never really enjoyed it, have made many other complaints. This is the pits. This is a majority state-owned company, what are they playing at? We have been refunded for hotels, planes etc only Eurostar is not acting fairly.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Poor service	Poor service. Cannot travel from Australia to Europe due to Covid 19. Emailed asking for refund. Was told no cannot have a refund you need to apply for a voucher. Emailed them back to say we will not be travelling to Europe in the next 12 months so please refund my money. Received a response saying they will not refund and need to apply for voucher. Why are they not refunding money. I am not a local to Europe (live in Australia) and will not be travelling to Europe in the next 12-18 months so a voucher is worthless to me.15.06.20 - update to my review above. My train was cancelled and I was notified by both text and email. I was offered the voucher option again, however found the refund link on their website and completed this. Receipt of this form was acknowledged and refund was back on my credit card within 3 working days. This has provided us some relief, however if we ever do make it back to Europe in the future, will not use Eurostar.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Terrible customer service	Terrible customer service. I understood when I phoned them that I could get a refund within 24 hours if train or hotel cancelled. Also in the meantime I could apply for a voucher but not invalid date any refund later. Now they say no you can’t. Don’t believe anything they tell you in my opinion. They reading other reviews now I see they will do anything to avoid refunds due to corona virus. E voucher not valid for the dates they offer as travel currently prohibited effectively.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Eurostar does not respect laws and regulations	I booked two return journeys around Easter but they were cancelled due to the corona. I had changed the outward journey before the coronavirus crisis and paid an extra fare. I contacted Eurostar to get a full refund as I am entitled per the current regulations. First I was only offered a voucher which I could not even use for Easter 2021 then I managed to get a partial refund and I was told I would not get a refund for the extra fare. This goes against both international rail regulations and UK trade laws as I paid for a service that I didn't get.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Promptly fully refunded for cancelled Train	Eurostar informed us last Saturday that, no surprise, our Paris to Brussels train was cancelled. We read some of these reviews and were a bit concerned given the negative comments. However we called Eurostar on Tuesday and a pleasant Roxanna arranged to give us a full refund within minutes. Refund appeared in our account yesterday so all good.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Wording to help others with Eurostar refunds	If you're like me and EuroStar are saying your train is still departing, when we all know that during the pandemic & government lockdown, passengers can only make essential travel to shops or work, so Eurostar know we cannot travel.. Especially internationally. I have advice from a legal / travel expert, who gave the wording below to help with refunds, even if train is scheduled / goes. Up to you what you do, this in only what I did:I've sent them a letter saying I'm due a refund due to:Impossible for EuroStar to fulfil passenger contract due to government restriction ban on non-essential travel Passenger contract rendered impossible – Illegal to travel during the pandemic Frustration of passenger contract - illegal to travel during the pandemicI was advised do NOT request a change or cancel your non changeable ticket, as then they can say you changed / cancelled and they won’t necessarily need to credit/refund you, if your ticket was non changagable.They're actions are effectively robbing us on my hard earned money.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Stand and deliver, Highwayman called Turpin now runs Eurostar	Disgraceful service. In lockdown, can’t travel to the railway station, can’t get the train, can’t enter France as a tourist, can’t get money back! Booked a trip for an anniversary, travel and hotel. The hotel is even closed! Eurostar refuses refund. Travel insurance won’t pay out as Eurostar offer compensation in form of a voucher I cannot use due to future work commitments. Credit card won’t refund as Eurostar have a non refund policy.  The whole thing is a disgrace. Never again will I use Eurostar. Does their CEO realise the damage being done to us honest people, further does the CEO know how much damage being done to Eurostar through killing it’s reputation!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Mixted feelings!	Eurostar as a train and experience is great! For they deserve more than 3 start for that. Their policy regarding current situation, is dreadful, they deserve less that one star.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Very Mixed Review	Firstly I have a good travel experience actually on the train. The rest of the experience is not so good. The terminals are far too much like the airport experience. The staff are generally good and the food is adequate. The toilets are not a pleasant experience. In the Covid19 lockdown their policy towards refunds is in bad faith and close to being illegal. They seem to try and frustrate customers in order to persuade them to accept a time limited voucher. It is clear from their schedules that services have been cancelled with a very limited skeleton service to and from Paris and Brussels but they will not accept as cancelled any service more than 48 hours in advance.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3
2020-06-01T16:01:45Z	Awful policy - deserve 0 stars	I think it is disgusting that Eurostar are not giving money back for cancelled trains during this coronavirus pandemic. To offer a voucher is not good enough. We do not know if travel will be available again and to make people book by the end of September, to use by the end of March 2021 is appalling. The least that could be done is give a voucher to use in the next couple of years. All other forms of transport; airlines, trains etc. are giving full cash refunds, which is how it should be dealt with. I shall not be using Eurostar again in the future.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Fine, voucher is better than to loose money at all.Claimed the voucher, been told will be given a voucher to the FULL VALUE of the journey.Received a voucher for£190 instead of £250. In general I have purchased the tickets for myself and my mum for £178, however later paid additional £72 for the extension. When spoke to the lady on the phone been told will be given full value again.none ever mentioned that extensions can not be claimed as a voucher.Just called, lady on the phone did not even introduce her name and was insisting that i can not get a voucher for the extension. When I told her for the third time that it is not mentioned anywhere she put me on hold and disappeared. After 10 minutes being on hold the line just cut off. Tried to call back and the voicemail said that this department is now closed.SERIOUSLY???This is how you do value your customers???This is a joke!!!!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

They refuse to refund me as they say ""I waved my rights for a refund when I asked for a voucher"".

2020-04-28T16:18:17Z	Unethical Business Practice sure you cause you anxiety	Always a mess dealing with Eurostar even more so now in a time of crisis with COVID-19. Both of my trains were cancelled and I was only offered vouchers - neglecting the small print - terms of carriage. Trying to get my money back is more difficult and time consuming than most hurdles in life. I wish as a company you haD a gram of moral obligation but in my experience you have none.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Extremely disappointed that I have to jump through hoops to get a refund.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-04-28T16:18:17Z	Bad customer service	Eurostar provides very limited information on the current timetable. In particular, the company did inform me that my train is not leaving a day before the train left in the afternoon. I could also not find this information online. Furthermore, the company tries everything to avoid reimbursing ticket prices when a train is canceled. The customer service is not satisfactory.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-04-13T11:34:29Z	Unethical Eurostar	Everyone is fully entitled to a refund when they cancel the trains, yet Eurostar are acting appallingly by pushing e-vouchers. Consumers are vulnerable at this time and do not need to be swindled into getting e-vouchers they may never be able to use. Completely unethical by Eurostar who are worried only about profits and completely disregarding people's rights.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-04-13T11:34:29Z	Eurostar’s concern is money during COVID-19	Eurostar refuses to give refunds during this COVID-19 crisis.   Their main concern is keeping money of people who aren’t allowed to travel.  This is the one company that will not do the right thing.  All other travel services, airlines, hotels, tour companies have refunded money, but Eurostar still refuses.   I will never forget how they treated us during this worldwide pandemic.   Shame on them!UPDATE (4/15/20):  I was scheduled to travel on 4/13/20 and received NO NOTIFICATION that my train was cancelled.  I tried to see my train on the site but it was so difficult, couldn’t see it at all, no notice of trains cancelled.    So I decided to act like I was buying a ticket, took a screenshot of the train that was running (was not my train) and sent that to Eurostar.  It was only then that they advised that my train was cancelled and offered a refund.  This seems like extraordinary measures that we have to take during these unprecedented times.  It’s sad that they won’t do the right thing for its customers.  This whole experience just confirms that I will not use them in the future, because they clearly have lost site of how to treat customers.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-04-13T11:34:29Z	How to get refunds	Eurostar does not want to give refunds due to covid19. They make this process difficult and even their website keeps pushing their vouchers. Refund option is only hidden in small print in very vague language and the corresponding page to file a refund seems to decline even VALID refund request. HOWEVER, 90% of their train schedules are cancelled so you can file for a refund using this reason. Wait until they finalize their train schedules 1 day before your trip before filing for the appropriate refund. If you ask them to refund you a week before your trip, they will merely decline your refund request. Write them an email asking for the refund. Cite the fact that they were the ones who cancelled your train schedule and that you do not want a voucher. Inform them that this is based on Passenger Rights Regulations. We were able to claim a full refund via this process.  However if your train schedules happen to be operational on that day then you are out of luck and your only recourse would be to take their voucher.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3
2020-04-13T11:34:29Z	Disgraceful refund policy	Gave a £69 voucher for a £309 trip with a short shelf life that is unlikely to be used then asked  not to use as has been sent in error and stated something would be sorted in the future.Advised not to travel, train was actually cancelled in the end.

If I don’t have to, then I’ll never use them again.With £1000 on the line that in effect they have taken for no reason I have used my credit card to force a charge back - hoping as many of us as possible can do the same to get our hard-earned money back from these thieves.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Unlike many of the airlines, I was able to already cancel my train that I had booked for late May, and have been offered a voucher which I can then use at a later date. I understand that as a business they probably can't afford to refund everyone in cash immediately, and have been happy with the customer service and clarity of ther response. In previous contact with Eurostar I have always found them to be helpful and empathetic.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5

2020-04-13T11:34:29Z	Eurostar absolute criminals, greed of the greatest degree	Can't put a zeroI was planning to travel to Belgium to celebrate a landmark birthday with family. Belgium closed their borders to tourists weeks ago, so by that point Eurostar were unable to provide the service I had paid for.I contacted Eurostar, no response at all on attempt number 1. Tried again, zero empathy and no flexibility in the timescale of vouchers offered.I object to their system of only giving a voucher that must be booked by a certain time and to then travel at times I do not want to go. I might be swayed if the voucher extended to the end of April so I could attempt to re-do the birthday celebrations a year later. Absolute refusal to give me a voucher extended by one month.All hotels in UK and Belgium have refunded in full, UK train service promised a full refund (not received yet).Who knows when Belgium will re-open it’s borders, what will survive in Belgium and whether it will be worth going?Now my train has been removed from the list of services. No communication from Eurostar!. Just hoping they can keep my money.I have raised a complaint with my credit card company – you do have some protections (maybe) but if enough credit card companies & banks pound them with refund requests maybe they’ll change their policy?Will avoid ever travelling on Eurostar again regardless if this gets resolved, would rather spend hours throwing up on a ferry.I cannot see that they are regulated by any travel organisation, they are however, regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. They recommend complaining to the Financial Ombudsman:Trustpilot won't let me load the links, easy to find. Check the FCA first and follow consumer/how to complainFCA do have an email address for fraudulent activity.

2020-04-13T11:34:29Z	Unacceptable response to COVID-19	We were booked for a tour of London, Paris and Scotland in May. WestJet has already issued Flight Vouchers valid for 24 months. All hotels have issued 100% refunds Eurostar is only offering eVouchers that will expire in Sept 2020. If we don't reactivate the trip by this September you're keeping my money (2 return tickets London - Paris) This is absolutely Unacceptable!!! Shame on you Eurostar! What's stopping you from matching the rest of the world wide travel industry?? You understand that International Travelers cannot simply move travel plans in a week or so. In my case we can only reschedule for May 2021.  You deserve to be flogged as common THIEVES!!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-04-13T11:34:29Z	Immoral Eurostar	Very angry with Eurostar and how difficult it was to get a refund! I booked a trip with my friend who was due to come from another country to visit. Not only were we initially not allowed a refund during the Coronavirus outbreak, but I wasn't able to have the money back for her ticket! I applied for an evoucher to at least maybe try to rebook but I can't have the portion linked to her passenger info. I paid for her tickets so why do I not get value even in vouchers? We were able to cancel with no fees and little difficulty with every other company we booked with (positive shoutout to Air Canada, Air BNB, and Booking.com) except Eurostar. Absolute thievery in a time of crisis. I requested the vouchers over two weeks ago and still have not heard back my train is due to leave tomorrow. After contacting them via Twitter, an employee offered me a full refund in my DMs. They then sent me vouchers. So I screenshotted the employees response on Twitter and sent it to Eurostar and I now have a full refund.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	2
2020-04-06T16:43:17Z	No refund option?? Immoral !!	I can’t give a zero but would like to give a minus number.  It’s totally immoral that Eurostar are not giving refunds when we are told we cannot travel.  I have been told to look the day before I am due to travel and if my train is cancelled then the Trainline would be obliged to refund me.  However the train line have said that it is the responsibility of Eurostar to sort this out.  I have spent hours emailing and responding but have got nowhere.  The train line were excellent about refunding the other journeys I had booked and sorting out the European train refunds onwards.  Eurostar need to give refunds. I will not want to travel.

Today's news for Brits:Coronavirus: Brits told to cancel holidays 'indefinitely'' as Foreign Office changes travel advice!The advice just changed from canceling for 30 days to 'Indefinitely'.I looked on the Eurostar app and see our train Has a question mark.But....they continue to say, keep your original booking or you may change the booking for another date free of charge. How can one choose another date when nobody knows when it is going to be safe? Or our governments 'indefinite' will end!When I originally contacted Eurostar I was told that they are tasking the situation gradually as things move on, and if We wanted to change the date then we could with a £40 fee.Surely it is illegal to keep our money if our government is advising us NOT to travel?Had no problem with getting a full refund for two weeks accommodation.

2020-04-06T16:43:17Z	Vile and unethical during COVID-19 pandemic	I’m only giving a 1 star rating because I can’t go lower.With this pandemic and hotels cancelling on clients due to safety issues, all other companies offering refunds due to their complete understanding of the impact of corona virus, Eurostar are the only company digging in their “unethical heels” by refusing refunds but only offering vouchers.Worse still, this company are clearly elitist as first class passengers are receiving a full refund but those who couldn’t afford first class and can ill afford to lose their money are not. Is this fair?? No it’s not!! It’s disgusting and nauseating at best.With peoples livelihoods at risk with companies months away from closure or making redundancies, with many of us I hate to say at risk of contracting the virus and not surviving it - what Value is there in an e-voucher?? None!! It doesn’t put food on a families table.Of course Eurostar know this and it’s not something that never crossed their mind, it’s just something they don’t give a damn about. This is about self preservation and bonuses at top level. Only two wordS to describe this company - VILE and UNETHICAL!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-04-06T16:43:17Z	Unable to travel with Eurostar - yet no refund available	"We don’t want to cancel our travel with Eurostar but due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) and specifically the following information we are unable to travel with Eurostar during May 2020.The French Government has introduced tighter border controls due to Coronavirus (COVID-19). This means that passengers will only be allowed to cross the border into Europe if they are: EU citizens of mainland continental Europe returning home/UK & Non-EU citizens with a residency permit in an EU country/Essential workers, which is equivalent to a cancellation of the service for ineligible passengers.We are non-EU citizens who had intended to visit Belgium using Eurostar and due to our age and health have no idea whether we will be able to travel again or be alive to travel again. An e-voucher may potentially be worthless.All UK Rail Operators we had advance bookings with have considered that these are unprecedented times and have offered refunds on prepaid tickets, including Advance Tickets, waiving cancellation fees as well. Standard refund policy should not apply in these unprecedented times where Governments are making extraordinary decisions for the welfare of their citizens.Despite Eurostar stating ""Our main priority is the health and wellbeing of our customers and colleagues. We are listening closely to the feedback of our customers and colleagues"", they remain inflexible despite extenuating circumstances outside the control of all concerned in providing refunds for Standard and Premium Tickets purchased for many who either have no idea whether they will travel in the future or may be physically unable to. Eurail, however, are  offering the following: please see their website /coronavirus-updateIf you purchased a full-price Pass on or after June 1st, 2019 and before April 1st, 2020, you are entitled to a 100% refund (normally 85% refundable).If you purchased a promotional-price Pass on or after June 1st, 2019 and before April 1st, 2020, you are entitled to an 85% refund (normally non-refundable).Why?Eurail - We care deeply about the health and safety of our customers and want to support all travelers who were planning to travel with a Eurail or Interrail Pass. We strongly believe that health is more important than mobility. We are therefore suspending our normal cancellation policy for travelers who are affected by Coronavirus."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

It is my right to receive the full refund but they kept replying my email with a voucher which is futile for me as the tickets i bought was for my family who lived overseas and may never know when they’re coming back to the Uk so a voucher would be futile. First email i got was them confirming a refund and then a 2nd email i was told an E Voucher is the only option so I rejected that and argued i needed the full refund and not voucher but they keep on coming back with the same rubbish ! please refund my money back since you were the one who cancelled my trip and it is my RIGHT to receive the full refund! please do the right thing Eurostar, don’t prolong this issues any longer than it already is.

I booked tickets for the service from London to Paris, a couple days before the train is set to leave Eurostar cancels the service. That's fine, its understandable. But when I go to get a refund since I was not the one to cancel, they can't provide one. The website even says it will provide a refund if the train is cancelled, yet they are trying to give me an eVoucher? Which needs to be used within a year, and is impractical for an American who was on vacation in Europe, and won't make it back in the foreseeable future. There isn't even a phone number to call in regards to refunds or customer service, only a number to call if you would like to book and that includes a service charge. I would never use this company again to travel with how terribly they treat their customers.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-04-06T16:43:17Z	Eurostar care only about themselves.	Every other train company is offering a refund for the trains they can't run. Eurostar only offers a voucher with time limits. Even if you use those vouchers you'll either pay more for a higher price ticket or, if the new booking is cheaper, lose money with no refund. Just appalling.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-04-06T16:43:17Z	Apply for a refund if you see that your train is not running.	I am not surprised that Eurostar have not asked to see their Trustpilot reviews. It could make very painful reading for them if they actually cared about delivering proper customer service.After 2 previous attempts to get my money back for travel booked to France and back on 1st and 2nd April, I checked on the day before my scheduled journey and found that my train was not running. I contacted Eurostar again and they agreed to refund the cost of both the outward and return journeys. They should be doing this anyway irrespective of whether your train runs as travel to France is prohibited for the vast majority of people!. Anyway, my advice is before your date of travel CHECK TO SEE IF YOUR TRAIN IS RUNNING and if not then email them and ask for a refund. Most trains are cancelled so you have a good chance. This should be an automatic option for everyone at the moment. we shouldn't have to fight for it. I have had refunds from accommodation owners and from other train companies without any problem. Those suppliers of course are not a one star operations like Eurostar.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-04-06T16:43:17Z	UNETHICAL!	It is extremely disappointing to not receive the option of a refund from Eurostar or at the very minimum a 24 month voucher. Instead, they state they are still operating trains and therefore their Conditions of Carriage still apply ... Ummm, I cannot get into the EU as a non-EU citizen, how on earth am I supposed to get to France to catch the Eurostar? Hotels have cancelled and refunded all bookings, it is only right that transport companies do the same! Eurostar's offer of a voucher to be booked before September 30, 2020 and used before March 31, 2021 is completely nonsensical. Not only are the first 6 months of that voucher completely useless due to the GLOBAL BORDER LOCKDOWNS and EU restrictions but to expect people to book new dates under duress before September 2020 is unfair and illogical. We are international travellers - we simply cannot rebook an entire new international holiday on a whim. We need approvals from work, school and global government border security to travel. At the very least, the FAIR and RIGHT thing for Eurostar to do is offer a 24 month voucher. Or the current e-voucher option but with the option to refund after March 31, 2021 if we have not been able to secure new travel dates. Unscrupulous behaviour and a prime example of corporate greed. I certainly won't use again. Flights much cheaper and faster then this novelty mode of transport. Don't waste your money or energy.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-04-06T16:43:17Z	The buck stops with the CEO!	This company is a total disgrace and the CEO should be totally ashamed of himself and step down, the buck stops at the top. I live in New Zealand. I booked tickets for myself and husband on Eurostar for April/May 2020 as part of a greater trip to the UK. All airlines, hotels, tour companies and Trainline have agreed to full refunds due to the Covid 19 pandemic. I graciously thank them and will re book with them when I can. Eurostar want to provide an e-voucher that is valid for less than 12 months! Do you know CEO where New Zealand is? It's not easy just to pop over and re plan a large trip again. You are a greedy unpleasant company that have no interest or care for your customers and at such a tragic time too. People want their hard earned money back, its not yours its ours so show some decency and the public will support you in the future if not, I daresay there maybe a sad future for Eurostar after this.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Is there a public manager that I can make a formal complaint? look at how customers respond:By Email:Me:Unfortunately, it will not be possible to use the voucher before March 2021, as my trip had to be canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and with that I have no prediction of when I will make my trip again. Therefore, I request the cancellation of the voucher and, consequently, the refund through the credit card used at the time of purchase. I await an answer.EUROSTAR:Hello,As your train went ahead as planned and was not cancelled, we are unable to offer you a refund. You can still claim the e-vouchers however. If you are not happy with that, I advise you to contact your travel insurance to see if they can cover any costs.With kind regards,RaikoEurostar Customer CareMe: I would like to clarify some facts,first my train was canceled and there was a change of schedule due to reduced travel, I would like you to check the information, and another point as the passengers were not European we could not board due to the restrictions of the French government. We buy tickets on several train companies in Europe such as: Deutsche Bahn, OuiSncf, Flixbus, Ouibus among others. All companies refunded the ticket, except for your company, I am very disappointed with the conduct of the Eurostar company, I had already traveled a few times with the company, and I have always spoken well about the company until now.EUROSTAR:Hello,Your train was not cancelled. It was one of the 3 trains still going on the 26th of March. If we cancelled your train, you would also have received a refund from us as you did from the other companies you mentioned.

2020-04-06T16:43:17Z	I have been told I cannot have a refund…	I have been told I cannot have a refund due to covid-19 and would have use my ticket before March-June 2021 when I cannot get holidays from work  then due to Disney land Paris being closed on the 29th of June when I am supposed to go this year. I Work for Royal Mail and cannot guarantee I will be allowed  holiday in that period . If I cancel any holidays this year to use this will still mean losing money on another holiday this is unfair as not our fault we cannot go a terrible service I would not recommend	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-04-06T16:43:17Z	Terrible company who tried to trick me out of my refund	I had a terrible experience with Eurostar.I had train tickets booked to take my family to Eurodisney, a trip cancelled due to coronavirus.However, Eurostar added greatly to the upset by acting in a breathtakingly dishonest and underhand way, by hiding the fact that a refund was a possibility.As my train was a cancelled I had a right by law to a refund. In their own terms and conditions they state that you can get a refund if a train does not run.However, they failed to put any information about refunds onto their website, implying that your only option is a credit note.  This was the same in emails that they sent to me when I asked the question to then directly. They purposefully did not mention refunds as being a possibility.I then threatened to report them to trading standards unless they refunded my money.  This worked and I now have my refund.I am deeply angry that such a large company would act in such a devious and deceitful manner.  How many people have they conned using this tactic - people who have lost hard earned money by being fobbed off with evouchers they don’t want rather than the refund they are entitled too. How dare they exploit a national tragedy in this way, this is dreadful behaviour.I will never use them again and I’ll fly to Paris in the future.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-04-06T16:43:17Z	I only gave you 1 star as you did…	I only gave you 1 star as you did actually reply.I have saved up for a family trip to disney and paid for the train in full. Over £500.No we are in lock down and can not got. Due to the size of the party we can not re arrange this trip but you are not willing to offer a refund.Ive been forced to close my business due to the virus and need the money back to live on.Your reply was sarcastic and belittling.I will never use your company again and will spread the word of how badly you have dealt with this.Youve taken my money and cant offer me the service not my fault pay it back kow.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-04-06T16:43:17Z	Very bad customer service	"During the pandemic of covid-19 Eurostar has proved they don't have any consideration for customers.They refuse to give me a refund unless they cancel the train exercise., however we are in lockdown only to leave the house for food medicine work. And exercise.So how can I possibly leave the house to travel to London to board the Eurostar.I've contacted the financial ombudsman re5 my refund.But hey Eurostar you get zero stars from me .If you treat your customers right and offer refunds along with E-vouchers , you may get customers opting for the E-voucher based on their current circumstances because of Covid-19.Dear Mrs Yildiz,Thank you for your e-mail to Mike Cooper our Chief Executive, on whose behalf I am responding.I am sorry that you remain disappointed with the current policy regarding ticket refunds and I appreciate that this is a difficult time for customers and businesses alike. I would also like to assure you that your comments regarding this, have been logged for the attention of our senior management. While one customer’s feedback may not warrant a change in policy, if we receive enough feedback to determine that customers are not happy with the current structure, then this may indicate that things need to be reviewed and some changes made.At present we haven't been issued with the finalised timetables for trains on 22 or 25 April 2020. These will be released 24 - 48 hours before the actual dates. In the event that either of your trains are cancelled, then you will be eligible to claim a refund for your return tickets, which is in line with Passenger Rights Regulations (PRR).If your trains are both still running, then the option would be to claim the e-voucher to the value of the amount paid for the ticket. Although this must be used by 30 September 2020, passengers will be able to select travel dates up to 29 March 2021. If you are unable to use this due to your personal circumstances, then there is the option to allow someone else to use it in your place.Failing that, then you can contact your travel insurer to see if you are able to claim for the cost of your unused tickets through them. I am sorry that I am unable to agree to your request at present but please keep an eye on our website, www,eurostar,com, for further updates regarding the timetables on 22 and 25 April 2020. Once these have been released, then you will have a better idea of which option is best for you. I wish you all the best at this difficult time and remain available if you have any further questions.Kind regards,NatalieChief Executive's OfficeEurostar International Ltd.

2020-04-06T16:43:17Z	Quick Response	I applied for a refund explaining my circumstances today and received an email within an hour explaining I’d be granted my refund and should receive it in 7-10 days. The matter was handled quickly,  particularly as I expected to struggle because of people saying they couldn’t get one. I’d advise everyone to email via prr.eurostar.com. My request was initially declined but an email was sent after with my refund details.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5

2020-03-31T12:39:03Z	Shameful	Shameful - they are refusing to refund although France will not let me enter the country and they are only running one train a day, not the one I booked, but still wont refund even though they cannot fulfill the contract for the service booked.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-31T12:39:03Z	id give 0 stars if i could	id give 0 stars if i could. what a joke of a company. clearly they have no clue about 1999/44/EU or CRA2015. For any of you struggling to get a refund. DO NOT accept an eVoucher under any circumstances, by doing so you legally accept their resolution. Refuse the eVoucher and contact your bank. They can charge it back.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-31T12:39:03Z	I am not going to be able to travel on…6th April	I am not going to be able to travel on 6th April through no fault of my own. Was taking my daughter to Paris for her18th Birthday.Unbelievable that I am unable to get a refund when am not allowed to travel due to travel restrictions both in the UKand France.  Airlines have refunded passengers where they are unable to honour bookings so why is Eurostar any different. These are unprecedented times so normal cancellations should not apply!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-31T12:39:03Z	I am simply speechless	Sorry, there is not much to say about this horrible company other than all the last comments did. No refund for cancelled trains, even as a EU citizen we will not be able to get to Brussels, so how can they refuse a refund? Even Deutsche Bahn allows you to cancel any trip these days or give you a FIVE year voucher (which is still so much better than the joke voucher of Eurostar). Totally inaccetable.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-31T12:39:03Z	No regard for customer, they should be ashamed	Eurostar’s attitude towards customers is truly appalling.I have had to cancel a forthcoming Family trip to Eurodisney and then Paris due to CoronaVirus. Had booked it all ourselves with a range of trains, planes and hotels. Every single other operator, some big companies, some small independent hotels have offered a full refund without question. Because it’s the right thing to do.Eurostar only offering evoucher which will be of no use as unfortunately we won’t be able to travel again within the required times They should be ashamed of how they treat their customers	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-31T12:39:03Z	Absolute disgrace...boycott and bankrupt this company now!	It is no surprise that Eurostar are an immoral disgrace of a business. The CEO, Mike Cooper should frankly be imprisoned for fraud and ripping off customers and I know there are 1000s of customers out there who would agree 100% with me. A bit of background...Mike Cooper has been in senior roles in EasyJet, then Arriva and then Yodel. Literally 3 of the worst companies on the planet with the worst track records for staff attitude and company performance. How sad that a once excellent business like Eurostar has employed such a person to destroy their business. In these unprecedented times, I have no doubt whatsoever that decisions like the ones I will describe are being made by the board of directors in companies, and ultimately it is the CEO, as they are accountable. As per the huge number of reviews in the last 2 months that are ALL 1* (and would be 0* if that was an option), this is the scenario...many people booked travel from the UK to France or Belgium in good faith to enjoy well earned breaks. In many cases, like mine, this was a surprise trip (in my case for my fiancées 30th birthday celebrations) and we were very excited about travelling to Eurodisney in late May.Then COVID-19 came along. As of a couple of weeks ago, ALL foreign travel was banned by the UK government. So I can’t travel by Eurostar. Disney closed ALL of its sites worldwide including Paris. The Radisson hotel near Disneyland Paris is closed.So why would I want a train trip to Disneyland Paris on Eurostar? And why would I want to put our lives at risk? And why are you not offering full refunds? And why do you think e-vouchers that are valid for a few months are acceptable to customers, when your business may not (and hopefully will not) exist anymore in several months time?! I have no idea in the current climate when we will be able to rebook our holiday!Customers want, need and should be legally entitled to full refunds! I also want to know why the UK and French governments have not stepped up their game and made it a legal requirement for ALL companies to issue full 100% refunds for customers who request this? We are legally not allowed to leave our houses except to buy food, drink and medicine so how the heck does Eurostar imagine we would make it to France?! Utter imbeciles.I genuinely hope there are some company CEOs who are arrested at the end of this pandemic, and I genuinely hope there are many businesses who never ever trade again as Eurostar is a national disgrace in the face of the many businesses out there who have evolved their companies and adapted to these extreme situations and looked after their customers.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-31T12:39:03Z	unbelievable attitude compared to other…	unbelievable attitude compared to other train companies!I just came off the phone with the eurostar customer service ( they even removed the phone number from their website!). I had travel booked , starting on the 3rd april 2020, 3 return tickets. They are currently only allowing people to rebook travel until the end of march 2021 .... my next holiday where I use Eurostar starts on the 2nd april 2021 and they told me I couldn't rebook for that date !!! It's just thievery, completely unjustified in these times, when all train tickets on SNCF can be refunded without quibble. No refund possible unless my train is actually cancelled, which I won't know until very close to the supposed travel date and time. And if I don t claim my e-voucher before departure? I lose the tickets altogether. Unbelievable. But not surprising knowing Eurostar.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-03-31T12:39:03Z	Eurostar thievery	In light of the current situation non-EU / non-UK citizens cannot travel from London to Paris. Moreover, governments in both France and the UK are advising against non-essential travel. Yet, Eurostar refuses refunds by saying that trains are running and those who can’t or won’t travel will only be offered a crappy Voucher to be used within a limited time period. No one in their right mind can plan or predict when it would be possible for them to travel again. All other travel companies (trains, airlines, hotels) are offering hassle free refunds as these are exceptional times. Yet, Eurostar is behaving like everything is good and normal.Despicable and deplorable!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-31T12:39:03Z	Risking people's lives by forcing them to travel just to make money!	I booked my ticket in January for my trip in February and when outbreak happened, first I wanted to cancel it. I contacted Eurostar and they told me it is not a risk and there is nothing wrong and I can travel. Then France set a lock down, I contacted to cancel my ticket and they said they run a normal service with clean trains. I paid twice of my train ticket and changed it as they forced me, however governments started to lockdown right after. I contacted again and they said they still have reduced time table and clean trains and they can't cancel or refund. Then they started to offer e-vouchers that you have to use in 2020. I DON'T WANT E-VOUCHERS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS CRISIS! It is a SHAME that just to keep money they refuse to refund and trying to make most of the pandemic! They just take your money, risk your life and keep all the money to themselves. Now I am sitting with a £350 train ticket (with change fee) for a trip maybe I will never be able to make. You are horrible, you just  want money and even in this crisis you want to save your own company rather than people's lives. Just cancel the tickets and refund our money back! And keep your useless e-vouchers to yourselves.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-03-31T12:39:03Z	NO refund and RIPPED OFF voucher	Refusing a refund and given a gift voucher LESS than what I paid for. Much like everyone else, unable to travel and NOT being given my money back. The voucher finally came through, weeks later, after a horrific phone call with the terrible customer service team. I spent £218 and received a voucher for £59? Are you serious? And I’m expected to use that by June and PAY the difference? What a joke. Waste of money and time!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-03-31T12:39:03Z	Terrible customer service	Train cancelled. They go out of their way to NOT issue a refund... Pushing the gift voucher which must be used by a certain date and no guarantees that it's a reasonable price or even usable. And you lose your right to a refund.Additionally they have either disabled or willfully not fixing their refund request form.Surely it would be easy to just automatically refund all passengers whose train was cancelled? But no. They hold onto your cash and have not yet responded to a request via web message. (10 days and counting)Will not be using this company again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Terrible customer service experience. Greedy brand. I would use their trains only if I am force and I will others way of transportation as much as possible. The list of deceptions with them is so long, I am not going to list them down here.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-31T12:39:03Z	Find another method of travel	They say companies going forward will be judged by their response to the covid-19 pandemic. Sadly, Eurostar will not come out on the good side of history. They've cancelled trains and ppl are literally banned from travel, but hey, here's your pitiful voucher that will expire in a few months. When even airlines are cancelling for free, Eurostar sleeps just fine at night, knowing they're happily holding on to your money.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Obviously because of this pandemic, the parks are closed & we are actually on LOCKDOWN, therefore this means we cannot leave our homes unless ‘essential’. Eurostar are refusing to give refunds, absolutely appalling. Will NOT be using eurostar again!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-27T10:55:44Z	All trains cancelled but no money back	All trains cancelled but no money back. Instead there's an Evoucher that expires way too soon, which I can't use anyway so I've just lost my money and they get to keep it without doing anything for it in return. A new trip is more expensive anyway, so you have to spend MORE with their company to get your own money back. Every other company is simply giving a refund but not them. Wish I had never booked a train in the first place.Edit - to make it worse: they give you several vouchers that make up the total of your original trip. You can only spend ONE voucher so you're forced to book several trips to get your original money back. So I'm supposed to spend more and more with them. I also can't spend the voucher anywhere but at the Eurostar website, where I've never made a booking before. I make my bookings on the website of NS International and I can't spend my voucher there so my money is simply gone up in smoke. Quick way to get rich for them.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

DFAT(Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) have issued a warning not to travel to Europe due to COVID-19 Pandemic.2. Airline have cancelled their planes to go to Europe so I cannot get there.3. My accommodation have been cancelled as they are not accepting visitors due to COVID-19.4. France have cancelled entry to Non EU residents which I am.5. No public gathering so what do you think is going to happen to us. We should be in isolation even if we were allowed to travel.Please refund our money as we are not in a position to reschedule our trip in current climate. Be ethical and Fair to your customers. It was the whole Europe trip and most train operators and airlines have offered the refund so you could do the same thing as others.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-27T10:55:44Z	Very disappointed and down hearted that…	Very disappointed and down hearted that you will not allow refunds. Was due to travel to Disneyland paris with my 2 children and husband. First Disneyland closed, I rang eurostar and got told tough luck basically. Trains will still be running to an empty destination. Then the french and us in the UK go on lockdown I request again for a refund. Again no as the trains are still running.Now we are being advised to not travel. Actually we cant travel out of our own countries. So again i request a refund. I get told my train has actually now been cancelled. Great I thought. But no, still I am not eligable for a refund. How the bloody hell not?!? The service that I have booked and paid for, which was £360 by the way is no longer running. It has been cancelled. Yet I'm still expected to be ok with a bloody voucher to use at a later date.The whole world is in the midst of a pandemic, with no one leaving their house. People losing their jobs, people dying. £360 to a family who is going through all this is a hell of alot of money. That is food on the table for a whole month In this time of uncertainty, stress and anxiety. Nobody knows when they will be able to travel again so a voucher is useless to everyone. Do what's right for your customers otherwise you will have to customers left once this pandemic is over.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-03-27T10:55:44Z	Eurostar cancelled our train. Won't give a refund.	All train and flight operators have given full refunds during the Coronavirus lockdown for cancelled trips, the only company not doing so is Eurostar. Even though they have cancelled our train, they are refusing to give a refund. They will only give a voucher for up to one year. It's disgusting profiteering behaviour, they won't pick up any calls, and they are copy and pasting responses on twitter. According to their own terms and conditions, if they cancel a train, we are entitled to request and receive a full refund. They are not adhering to that.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-03-27T10:55:44Z	Eurostar gives capitalism a bad name	Eurostar encourages you to travel when governments ask you to stay home, driven only by the desire to keep your cash at all costs. A very very poor move, showing up the company and brand for what it really is: cash flow before people's health.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-27T10:55:44Z	Shameless and exploitative.	Eurostar's policy is indefensible when all of the other rail operators are offering full refunds. A refund is only available in this case if the service is cancelled, but cancellations are entirely at the whim of the operator, and refunds can be frustrated by running empty trains. Is Eurostar regulated in any way? Are they going down the shute? They must be aware that their competitors, the low cost airlines, are refunding their customers, and this will not go unnoticed whenever things return to normal.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-27T10:55:44Z	Should be zero stars	Should be zero stars. In a time of national and global crisis Eurostar are robbing people of their hard earned cash by not offering refunds.

2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Refuse to refund amongst COVID-19 crisis	"Bought tickets to Belgium for early April 2020, before COVID-19 hit. Let's not even get into the fact that their online booking system is shambolic and refused to take my payment (I had to phone up to book tickets – they even tried the ""our site only works in Google Chrome excuse, which I had already used).Fast forward to the height of the current crisis, it's STILL not possible, a few weeks away, to get a refund.I'm not even able to get an exchange since their current cutoff point is for tickets travelling up to April 7 (as if COVID-19 will have sorted itself out after that point).Shocking customer service with absolutely zero empathy."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Robbery Without A Mask!	Like many others our travel plans have fallen victim to the current Coronavirus containment measures - a 5 day over-weekend visit to London to include a day return on Eurostar to Brussels with other family members from the North of Scotland. The trip was booked months ago to take advantage of cheapest rail fares and overnight accommodation. It is not possible to reschedule or affordable to visit London simply to travel on a Eurostar train.Travel companies involved were pro active in contacting us offering the opportunity to reschedule or opt for a refund regardless of type of ticket bought or room rate secured. A massive “Well Done” to Premier Inn and LNER. Now what about Eurostar running trains to countries with “Closed Borders” - not heard a cheap during an ever evolving crisis. Speaking to somebody about the journey/tickets is an impossibility! Their policy of offering an e-voucher for rebooking and travelling within a limited window is quite frankly CRIMINAL at a time when Governments in Belgium, France and here in the UK are offering advice on “lock down” to curb the virus. WHY WOULD EUROSTAR ENCOURAGE TRAVELLERS TO GO ON A TRIP TO BRUSSELS (or Paris). THE IRRESPONSIBLE ANSWER IS “STAND AND DELIVER” COVID 19 VIRUS TO “A N OTHER” i.e. commercialism over compassion and common sense.To the CEO - Please switch on your TV or Radio and listen to Presidents and Prime Ministers telling citizens not to travel particularly if it’s a non-essential journey i.e. a one day leisure trip to cities that are locked down! Do the right thing and offer to refund fares. You might just get a huge financial bonus or recognition for steering the company through a difficult time on an unprecedented scale. PRESENTLY YOU ARE RISKING SEVERE REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE FOR WHICH YOU MUST SHOULDER TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY.When (not if) the company faces extreme financial difficulties from the severe reduction in ticket sales one must assume that you will not ask for any help from the Governments’ who’s advice you’ve disregarded by insisting it’s citizens must travel into the “eye of the storm”!I’m in the very fortunate position of being able to stand the financial loss here. Your fares were ridiculously high in the first place. Many who were perhaps “stretched” to buy the ticket in the first place may well be facing extreme financial circumstances through no fault of their own. DO THE RIGHT THING AND DEVIATE FROM “THE SMALL PRINT” AND OFFER REFUNDS NOW. DO NOT PREVARICATE WITH MEANINGLESS E-VOUCHERS.Customer Care rating presently is sub-zero and I for one would have to think long and hard about travelling with the company going forward.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Do The Right Thing Please	Come on dudes, this is appalling way to treat your customers. I cannot go to event in Amsterdam as it is cancelled. None of us want e-vouchers at this time, it is unthinkable to be making plans for holidays and such at this time, an e-voucher is useless. We want/need refunds. You should be doing this automatically where possible, alternatively don't make this such an impossible or difficult process. Do you not realise how much we are struggling right now?PLEASE, do the right thing.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Will never book with Eurostar again.	I will never book with Eurostar and will not recommend this company to anyone going to Europe, they are completely taking advantage of people during an epidemic. Every company has refunded our money and worked with us during this insane time, Eurostar would rather rip us off and every other customer by offering a 6 Month E-Voucher? what a slap to the face. This will catch up with them. I have been emailing them and they do not even read your email, they just send a scripted email that says the same thing over and over. terribly run company, wish i could put zero stars. Would be ashamed to work for this company.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Terrible service provider -	while all travel companies (airlines , hotels, trains etc) are doing everything they can to help their customers in these difficult times, Eurostar is making sure to make as much profit as they can by charging amounts that people cannot afford to get back home. They also do not offer any direct refund and is therefore forcing people to make other travel plans while we all know this is impossible. shame on you Eurostar	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Unlike other socially responsible…	Unlike other socially responsible carriers, unwillingness to offer refunds and encouraging passengers to either act in an illegal manner by making use of their bookings, or indeed simply knowing they cannot use them because this is against UK government advice AND due to the lockdown in France and Belgium. Will look to bring future personal and professional travel via air and other companies that are willing to act in a responsible manner.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Boycott Eurostar	I think it’s shocking that they are not offering any refunds in a time of crisis. This is a time where companies are showing their true colours and you are seeing true colours and those that really care about their customers. Eurostar are not offering refunds even though there is a travel ban. Yes the refund is a good gesture for those who are planning to travel at a later date, but our holiday to Disneyland Paris is not something we will rebooking for some time and a voucher is completely useless to me. Eurostar star have cancelled our train and therefore are not supplying the service they offered when I purchased my £360 ticket and should refund completely. If I ever plan on travelling to Europe once this pandemic is over I will not be using Eurostar and advise people boycott this company who really only care about profits and not their customers.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Pathetic dissmissive policy	I was going to travel next week from London to Paris for a pleasure trip. Due to the Covid-19 situation several restrictions have been put in place on French territory. Also, the UK government has advised against any non-essential travel abroad.However, Eurostar has decided to protect their shareholders instead of their customers by issuing an eVoucher that must be used by June to book a trip prior to the 12th of December, basically leaving all customers out of pocket in these difficult times.I will personally never travel again with Eurostar and I will make sure that anyone who I know is well aware of how cold and dissmissive this company is. If Eurostar collapses in the future due to this crisis I hope all shareholders remember the day in which they turned their backs on their customers, thinking in the short-term survival instead of the long-term business relationships.Good luck!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Would give 0 if I could	Would give 0 if I could. My train has been cancelled.... what is the point of these stupid vouchers??? Either give customers their money back or find them an alternative train?? W.T.F.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Pathetic service	I find it ridicilous that Eurostar has offered Vouchers to replace travel journey refunds for people who can no longer enter France, due to the coronavirus, and the Vouchers need to be used by June for a journey valid until December. Thalys trains have offered full refunds for ALL cancellations and EACH individual that had journeys booked received communication from the CEO of Thalys. Eurostar hasn't even sent an email. I have 3 tickets booked with Eurostar and one of them is a connecting journey with Thalys. I also have a stand alone ticket with Thalys which I have already received a FULL refund for. I cannot get a hold of any of the call center agents because the phone just rings and nobody answers. Pathetic service. Why can't the refunds be made instead of those stupid Vouchers? What if I am unable to use the Voucher by the end of June? What if I need to use less than the Voucher amount for a possible future journey? I want my money back, not vouchers. I expect to receive a response on this matter from Eurostar and I will continue to let people know what a rubbish service you'll provide.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	no help at all!!	Our other travel providers are doing everything they can to help us during this Covid 19 outbreak. Eurostar on the other hand has told me I’ve just got to wait & won’t even offer me the voucher. The voucher however wouldn’t be any good because we would like to put our holiday on hold until next year now, with high risk children in our family you’d think Eurostar would understand this!! So basically we will be losing our money, and it wasn’t cheap!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Dreadful stance with COVID-19 virus pandemic	During the COVID-19 pandemic crisis the only person they were concerned about was themselves. It took them a long time to arrange any sort of flexibility and by the time is was a global pandemic and France was on lockdown, they were still only offering vouchers with terms attached meaning they had to be used before the end of June and for trips before December 12th.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Outrageous response to covid-19 crisis	Their lack of flexibility regarding their refund policy is outrageous and utterly disgusting. They refuse to refund bookings despite the fact that both France and Belgium are in lockdown, everything is closed and governments basically deemed it illegal to travel witout serious motives. First and last time I am using their services. Rude and useless customer service which ignores all customers. Eurostar will pay for sure for how they are handling this when this crisis is gone.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Can I giv less than one star	Can I give less than one star? EUROSTAR stinks! We had to cancel our vacation to the UK and Bruges, Belgium due to the current ban. So far, most in the travel industry have been sympathetic or we are awaiting an answer to our cancellation refunds as many reservations were non-refundable back in olden times (by crackie!) All have been courteous. Eurostar has lashed back at everyone I see on social media, travel sites, their own site (their FB site totally ignores the Pandemic like it doesn't exist), etc They are only offering waiver of change of date fees and from what I see on the travel sites, etc is a customer service department told to hold the line and be rude to all their customers. I wrote to customer service, got a long winded business as usual response from their FB Messenger and their CEO issued a ridiculous inconsiderate statement as if they were doing everyone a favor, on their website. In the current situation, who knows when we would be able to re-book and they were only giving to the end of the year despite most of Europe closed for business for the foreseeable future. We were so looking forward to doing the high speed Chunnel thing but I will make sure everyone knows about our experience with Eurostar. Obviously Eurostar believes in the business model of Profits Before People. In the long run, they will pay dearly for this.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Capitalising on COVID-19	We were in Belgium for a short getaway at the end of last week and unfortunately the government decided to close all restaurants/ bars etc 1 day into our trip. So we decided to come back to the UK early; the Eurostar said we could exchange our seats but would have to pay the difference. The difference was £365 for 2 people! There were others queuing up to book as well, who were being told the same thing. We paid, but I saw a family have to turn away, because, like me they'd only used the Eurostar as part of their £29pp promotion. What's worse, is when we got the train back, it was pretty empty (so they had plenty of space to let people change for free). We were in carriage 11; 3 of the nearest toilets weren't working and 2 of those had no running water in them! There were also 2 without anything to dry your hands with. I couldn't believe we'd paid £400 to a company doing nothing to prevent the spread of COVID-19; infact, they were capitalising on it!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Might as well add my Covid19 complaint…	"Might as well add my Covid19 complaint to the pile. US travel ban to UK and France and had to cancel my trip. France closes boarder and they still won't refund. They still state it as ""if you choose"" not to travel. Ridiculous company!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Covid 19 - no refunds	If I could rate zero stars I would. Trip cancelled due to covid. No possible way to travel to Europe either now, or in the future. No refunds available, only vouchers which I will hope to somehow sell on eBay. Worst company ever. Clearly only care about money.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	Eurostar is THE worst traveling…	If I could leave minus 100 stars.... Eurostar is THE worst traveling company. You may spend millions in Eurostar and get to the highest level of their loyalty membership but still, EVEN during the coronavirus outbreak, you can't do anything: exchange tickets without leaving a member of your body, change the name of the reservation, cancel your trip is NOT possible, they may (if you're lucky and don't experience tech issues) issue you a voucher after a month!!!! they won't even give you your money back! you can't take a member of your family with you on the carte blanche (faster) lane. They treat people like s**t, they are extremely rude and their prices are INSANELY expensive. Their food is the worst it gives food poisoning.No humans in Eurostar, only robots. DO NOT BOOKOne day, they'll have a competitor and they'll have their eyes only to cry.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	COVID19 - useless evoucher for cancelled event - no refund like other companies	Booked the Eurostar for the Paris Marathon which got cancelled. Eurostar first advised that I'd be welcome to travel anyway as no problems (?!). Then they advised I can get an evoucher to travel at a later point. It's unclear to me which point of CANCELLED they have not understood, but I understand they do not take responsibility like other companies such as the German Railway Company which offers full free refunds as gesture of goodwill for cancelled events. 11 years loyal customer. Luckily there are other travel options with more supportive companies available for the future.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-21T11:38:40Z	The Coronavirus outbreak has really showed the company's true colours	"Eurostar states that its ""principal priority is the health, safety and wellbeing of our customers and colleagues"" which sounds all lovely yet ""continue to operate our trains to all destinations"". People all over the world are taking precautions to limit the spread of the virus: meanwhile this company not only refuses refunds, free cancellations or free date changes it lowers prices for its tickets in a seemingly malicious tactic to encourage people to continue travelling. The company's inability to create concessions in this extremely rare event of a global health crisis is astounding. Since the 13/03/2020 the company extended a little olive branch for travelers travelling between certain dates where they offered 'eVouchers' that can be exchanged to cover costs for a future travel date (also date limited). Arranging another holiday especially with other people (my case) is difficult because everyone is not easily available at the same time. Not to even mention that we don't know when the outbreak will be fully resolved and people can safely travel again. The company would much rather have an administrative hassle of creating these 'eVouchers' than simply offering refunds at this sensitive time and allowing travelers to re-book on their own accord. This just shows how much this company prioritizes keeping their revenue over the health and safety of passengers. Other train companies such as Deutsche Bahn (Germany) and Renfe (Spain) are issuing refunds with no questions asked so don't try and argue ""that's what businesses are like"". Eurostar simply does not have the capacity to harbour any ounce of sympathy -- even in extreme times of worldwide pandemics. I regret booking with Eurostar. I chose them because their trains take you from city center to your destination's city center and would be quicker than flying from airports. From now on I will just take planes even if it means en extra leg of public transport to and from the airport or if its more expensive-- and I highly recommend you do too. Flight companies have more competition and much better customer service. Even if you read this review after the Coronavirus has been overcome, and you are entirely certain there won't be some worldwide catastrophe in the months leading up to your holiday (Exactly what I thought too!!!) I want to ask you: Do you really want to support a company with values like this?"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	Don't book with Eurostar	Don't book with Eurostar. Virtually no customer service. Won't take coronavirus as a valid reason to give refunds or exchange without a fee. They now are offering eVouchers for travel between Friday 13 March and Tuesday 7 April, but considering the situation will most likely not improve after the 7th of April this is a rather poor attempt at compensation. Save yourself the money and stress and book other travel modes instead.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	Grasping and Rapacious	"During this worldwide health crisis, many transport companies (and others, even places like Disneyland) have stepped up to contribute their part and to take care of their customers in the interests of their health and safety and the greater community at large.Not only is Eurostar so far not stepping up to help their customers with credits, refunds or waived rebooking fees .... while the W.H.O. Issued a Level Three Travel Warning for many of the countries Eurostar serves, Eurostar’s even continues to promote travel to and from those venues to likely further help spread COVID-19 and contribute to additional sickness and death of those customers and communities.Shameful...Boycott!Update:  3/14/2020 -  I just noticed Eurostar has finally updated their web with an offer for eVouchers for certain travel due to COVID_19, let's see how it plays out.  Hopefully they are finally stepping up to the moral and ethical challenges!(This site does not allow URL's so go to the main Eurostar web and look at their special COVID-19 page...)Update: 3/17 - So now, apparently, they are cancelling a lot of trains but only posting the day ahead it seems, so not much lead time to poor passengers ...  at this point it seems a tactic by Eurostar to herd people to accepting their soft eVoucher and minimize their obligation to refund from them cancelling trains?Update: 3/18 - Still no substance.  Any legal firms out there considering a class action lawsuit?Update:  3/21 - So far they continue to be dodgy and unresponsive about refunds.  One train is canceled, the return from Paris next week (they know it, can’t book it on their site, but they won’t acknowledge it until it posts on their webpage on Monday....).  I did log a complaint with the UK gov watchdog londontravelwatch.org.ukUpdate - Mar 25 :  Well, true to form, checking on my app for my train today, even though it was canceled in various places on their web, they said it was still running but oddly asked if I wanted to reschedule or eVoucher ....  criminal deception, I would say.For those seeking refunds on trains they cancel, they do have a section on their web where you can do it (as it is required by EU law, I think)  but it is very buried way down in their menu system (too bad TrustPilot doesn't allow links in these...)However, if you go their website and at the bottom, under ""Contact Us""  it will bring up a help page..The on the bottom left there is a block about ""Compensation"" - choose ""See More""Then elect the link ""What Happens if Eurostar Cancels My Train""  (It brings up more things to wade through, of course they are focusing on rescheduling and eVouchers...)On the right, in the side bar there is a ""Most Popular"" section, select ""Can I cancel and get a refund online?""Brings up more stuff to wade thorough related to vouchers and the like, but scroll down and find near the bottom...""Other Questions You May Find Helpful""And select the link..Yet more stuff directing you to exchange, etc.But find the link..""What happens if Eurostar cancels my train?""And yet again, toward the bottom...""If you haven’t travelled yet and your train is cancelled click here for information.""And then, yet once more at the bottom of the page, you need to look carefully for this section...""Request a full refund, regardless of your original ticket conditions.""Be careful to look for and select the small text link that says...""Claim a refund""  that will finally take you to where you can enter your info for your cancelled train online.vs the big, more prominent BIG button ""CLAIM AN E-VOUCHER"" just below that section!Hope this helps some of you in this awful time, being treated so badly by this company....Update:  April 1, 2020  - Unless it's some cruel April Fools joke - ha!... I finally got a full refund!  It took a lot of time and aggravation and lots of persistence on my part vs the other carriers who stepped up right away at the beginning.  So a cautionary tale for those considering this one in the future, though I do appreciate them finally doing so!Update - My refund posted to my credit card, but man, how much time and energy and anguish it took to do what should have been easy and simple."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	Utterly disgusted and disappointed	Utterly disgusted and disappointed. I have been trying to get a hold of them for hours and hours now. No one answers their customer service, no one responds to emails and there's no way of reaching out. I am due to travel to Brussels and we found out we have to quarantine ourselves for 14 days starting yesterday as we are experiencing flu like symptoms and fever. Their website says they will help exchange or refund in such situation. But how can I claim any of this if they don't reply or answer their calls. DISGUSTING!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	Stay well away from this awful company	Stay well away from this awful company. They are prepared to risk sending children to Disneyland in light of the current situation. It's clear they are money orientated and dont care about their customers safety and wellbeing.

2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	Eurostart don't recognise Coronavirus is an issue!	My experience mirrors others.  I had planned a trip to Italy by rail, the first leg by Eurostar, sleeper from Paris to Milan, then the Italian high speed service to Florence then a regional train to Assisi.  The sleeper and Italian services have given refunds but Eurostar don't seem to think there is a problem and won't refund.  However I've just received an email from Eurostar to say that my train to Paris has been cancelled.  The email states I can get a refund, but the web page it sends me to does not allow a refund.  They don't say whether I can also get a refund for the return trip which hasn't been cancelled.  I can't contact them by 'phone - no answer and their chat line isn't responding even though it is supposed to be available from 7:00 to 23:00.  I've emailed them and got an automated reply stating that it takes 21 days for them to reply.  And the Eurostar tickets cost more that the other three rail tickets combined!BTW I'm not expecting much satisfaction from Eurostar judging by the experience of others and the robotic non-replies to reviews on this website.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	Eurostar refuse to change travel dates due to Coronavirus	Really disappointed with Eurostar. Due to run Paris marathon, which is postponed, and they have so far refused to move our train tickets to the new dates. All other things which my partner and I booked have accepted a refund (eg accommodation). Eurostar say “circumstances for travellers can change before a trip”. COVID-19 (coronavirus) is a pandemic - not a typical circumstance!I travel with the Eurostar frequently. Very sad to see they are willing to risk alienating a frequent traveller for a small profit, unlike so many other companies in the sector, when they could be forced to cancel the trains anyway in a few weeks time if the current number of cases continues to increase.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	they do not accept the coronavirus problem as a reason for the refund.	We bought a train ticket from EuroStar for an event in Paris. Many events in Paris have been canceled due to covid19. All other reservations have accepted a refund or cancellation. EuroStar customer representative simply said no. They do not refund. They insist on not understanding the coronavirus problem. Eurostar is an example of monopolization.Update: Line 0343 218 6186 is completely useless. They are not answering the phone calls anymore. I waited for 1 hour in the customer representative queue and then hung up.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	Eurostar is separating my family for their own fees...	I am curious as to why Eurostar wants to separate my family. I am taking a trip this week from London to Paris with my two daughters...When my wife was medically cleared to travel with us, I mistakenly purchased her ticket for a intl. flight and their train several hours earlier...I called them to explain this numerous times and all they would do was refer me to their website or offer me exorbitant  change fees for all three of us to get on her earlier ride...incredible?!? I have already purchased our tickets in January, hers in February, yet they won't let us stay together...Given the current situation of Corona Virus and a sharp decrease in world travel, you would think they would consider keeping a family together and provide for the situation...instead it appears they fear losing money in the time of an epidemic and charge more money to fill their pockets...Eurostar - if you're listening, reach out to me and make a difference in one family's life...don't be a corporate monger who doesn't give a care!! BTW, Delta took care of our international flights no problem...maybe you could take a clue from their action...thanksUPDATE 4 hours later...contacted them via Facebook and Messenger...still no help...even told them how Delta Corporate Office continued to help us and changed our flights to a later flight (for the whole family) so that we would only have to change the single seat for my wife and take the later train....still they sent me to their website to pay their change fees and new ticket price...still useless help...Maybe someone at the gate can help make this a reality...UPDATE: Corona Virus - President calling US citizens home...Delta immediately booked us on flights home...We are now in US want a refund on all Eurostar Tickets...Confirmation#s: QNYGHM and TRQIBS...waiting to hear from you Eurostar...	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	no customer service , just profit	What is the point to have customer service if they can’t help you with changing destination time or date? I’m not upset about people working in customer service for Eurostar but the people that made the rules. It is really unfair because they really don’t care if you make a mistake in your booking. For some reason when I booked my return ticket it booked it twice from the same destination in my case was London Amsterdam twice instead of London Amsterdam return. So I called the customer service and they said that they couldn’t change it. So I asked if I could cancel or get a refund and no you cannot do nothing you can’t even resell a ticket so that sit is going to be there empty for nobody to use. I don’t understand what is the point of this if I am not going to use that seat why can I not give it to somebody else to use? And if the website made a mistake why can’t you help me to change the destination? if you are really that cheap and customer service is not your priority then I don’t see the point to have a customer service office in the first place. I travel a lot with Eurostar so now that I know that their customer service is so bad I don’t think I’m gonna be traveling with you anymore so you just lost a customer. Honestly if I can travel with a different train company or a plane I will do that. It’s unfair to give money to people they don’t care about others.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

The customer service is terrible and I can totally relate to other customers' experience. You feel almost belittled, and a bit disrespected, with the lack of disregard for the customer. They clearly know that i'll be losing money due to the fact that I purchased a train ticket for a friend (in May) who can no longer travel with me. I've offered to pay a change fee and yet, I still cannot do so because the tickets are ""standard"". The ticket is still good for a year they say, however, it can only be used by my friend since it's in her name. This is just terrible policy and business all around. Refund? Nope. Of course not. I'm totally taken back by this company as other travel companies that i've used for this particular trip decided to work with me (and show a little compassion) due to the circumstances. Never again will I use this company."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	Horrible customer service	Horrible customer service.  Beware we purchased tickets to Paris Disney from London because on their website the dates we needed said No Trains Running Due To Scheduled Maintenance.  Then they opened up trains and started selling tickets to Paris.  They would not give me my money back to change trains even though their website changed.  I asked for anything to help me out.  I wasn't trying to change dates or anything, just change to what their website was now offering.  They offered me $4 per ticket back.  Rediculous.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

No refund option (not even partial) and to change or amend a trip it's impossible not to incur more expense - for a standard fare which costs hundreds of pounds (that's right, and this isn't a short notice booking) I would need to pay an additional £30-£60 to make a change to the time or date of the booking. Absolutely no surprises that the rating for Eurostar is poor. If I could give it zero stars, I absolutely would.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	Terrible policies	I have never used Eurostar before but was really looking forward to using them for the first time. My friend is coming to visit leaving the USA for the first time and suggested we go to Paris for the day since it’s so close. When I looked the tickets advertised were for £58 return but when I clicked through the price changed to £78 return per person. I booked these dates. Eurostar then 2 weeks later have the front to send me a “promotional email” advertising my trip, on the same dates for £58. When I spoke to customer service regarding this I was told they cannot refund the difference. Why is it I am paying more than other customers for standard seats on the same journey? And Eurostar are emailing me to advertise the cheaper rate?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	Absolutely disappointed	Absolutely disappointed!!! I have been a loyal customer for 10 years and what happened to me is a sign of very BAD service and management!!!! Today, after a long day at work I needed to change a leg of one of the many bookings I have with Eurostar. Unfortunately, I changed the wrong booking by MISTAKE and paid £30. I called the call center and they told me I would get charged AGAIN to change it back to the original booking!!!! This was an honest mistake that can happen to everyone, the fact that they don't take this into account is horrendous and very stressful. This is a clear fault in the system!!! I was also told by the man on the phone from the call center that I can fill out a form of complaint and wait for 2 DAYS for a manager to call me! I am shocked and discouraged to take the Eurostar in the future. BAD customer service!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	Unbearably uncomfortable trains	The old Eurostar trains used to be a reference for good train interior design. Excellent seats, subtle light, fantastic acoustic comfort and incredibly soft ride. I used to travel very frequently between Brussels and London with the old trains, never had an issue, train travel was a pleasure. Unfortunately, since the new trains arrived I have been finding travelling with Eurostar more and more an inconvenience. Simply put, the new trains are a disgrace and an absolute lack of common sense. I just traveled from London to Brussels and, once again, had a painfully uncomfortable trip. Is Eurostar ever going to do anything to bring back comfortable train journeys to its customers?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	More delays than Ryan air	Nice to get from a to b with a lot of luggage and good for the environment.

2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	We travelled back from Paris gare de…	We travelled back from Paris gare de Nord on the 25th of this month.When we got to check-in at the station the girl asked for our tickets ,  we were booked in standard premier and had two seats  opposite each other ,  she informed us that they had to change the train but assured us that the seat configuration would be the same and that we would be sat together.Why didn't I believe her . When we got on the train I was sat at one end of the carriage and my wife was sat at the other end , I showed the train manager the tickets and he just shrugged his shoulders and said it's full so we would have to sit in the new allocated seats. Also with the coronavirus making all the headlines I at least expected the train to have been cleaned so I was shocked when I pulled my table down only to see dirty smelly what look like somebody had  sneezed all over the place and spat the food out as well on it ,  lucky enough I was carrying  wet wipes so could clean it before use. The whole journey was was a trip from hell, the food was disgusting my wife left hers and I left mine too as I wasn't happy about using the table even though I had wiped it . We did complain to customer services and got a reply from Ellie it was quite frank and straight to the point it's not their responsibility read the small print we can change your train at any time and and we can't guarantee your seat together even though we paid extortionate price for standard premier , they also didn't have a lot to say about the dirty seats and the table , so basically the check -in lady the train manager and Ellie the customer service manager don't really care about their passengers it's easyJet for me from now on	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-03-14T12:42:42Z	Eurostar and Eurodespatch: The Foxtons of rail travel	"EDIT: Eurostar did eventually get in touch and refund the cost of baggage service. So, it turns out the Eurodespatch part of Eurostar, which takes sports equipment and heavy luggage, is actually worse than Eurostar itself. Who knew that was possible? I recently travelled with my bike to Barcelona from London. I left a healthy window of 1hr and 15 between the Eurostar arriving in Paris and my train to Barcelona departing. The Eurostar arrived a bit late, but no worries, I thought, I still had plenty of time to make the connection.And that was when disaster struck. The platform that the Eurostar came in on was undergoing renovation work, with the result that the baggage truck was not allowed onto the platform until all the passengers had cleared.This took the best part of 50 minutes (Eurodespatch says you can collect your baggage within 20 mins) and I missed my connection to Barcelona as a result. Those trains only go twice per day, so I was then forced to spend a night in a hotel in Paris, before continuing on the next morning, almost a day behind schedule.Complained to customer ""service"", but they haven't bothered to get back to me. I choose Eurostar because I want to fly less, to do the right thing. It'sbad enough that they operate a bike carriage service that is far more expensive than any other train company in the EU, and far less convenient than any airline. But to promise the customer they can get their bag back in 20 mins and then completely fail to deliver is even worse. They must have known about the ongoing renovation works. They must have known it was causing delays. Why not forewarn the customer and figure out a way to mitigate it? That they failed to do this smacks of incompetence, even callousness. Ultimately I paid anot insubstantial sum for what is obviously a mediocre service, only to find that they fell short of even that low standard. They're basically the Foxtons of rail travel!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-02-17T18:30:56Z	Seems like I was very unlucky!!	Change of ticket date only.After reading Eurostars reply I decided to reduce my rating of them to 1 star, after all if I charged my clients double for changing a day that they had booked with me I would be a rich man by now but have a lot of unsatisfied customers.. fortunately I believe in good customer service, so this wouldn't happen! .. it seems I was very unlucky for my travel tickets price to rise by £20 in less than a day after purchasing the original ticket on an almost empty train off peak costing me an additional £80 in total....I know it's in the rules, but Eurostar stand to make £160 because of a small error as they are not going to leave the seats I paid for originally empty, now are they ! This review may change depending on the journey.I haven't even started my journey yet.. but I have booked my tickets 5mths in advance. Unfortunately I booked my train to Paris a day later than I wanted (or did I ? As there are plenty of complaints about Eurostars booking process on their website and I was double checking everything I did with my wife!)I went back to the site the next day, I realized, there was going to be a fee (obviously) for changing days. My booking was for 2:20pm to leave for Paris so I clicked the correct day (strangley 2:20pm when we wanted to travel cost had jumped up by £20 as well as the Admin fee of £30 PER PASSENGER to change the ticket and (train is almost empty). I may be wrong but I think this was a deliberate extortion of an additional £20 from us to travel at the same time (all other non peak times were the same price). Decided to write this as a warning to other passengers (TRIPLE CHECK YOUR BOOKING BUT EITHER WAY YOU WILL BE STUFFED IF THEIR SITE GETS IT WRONG). Reviews are showing that Eurostar is performing very badly at 1.5 stars..!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-02-17T18:30:56Z	Poor communication	Writing this review sat in moutiers station waiting for the st Pancras train. It’s now nearly two hours late arriving and had absolutely no information from Eurostar about delay. Nothing on website. In fact the train doesn’t even appear on the site. Rang Eurostar and they had no idea what was going on. Not good enough. Delays can be tolerated but lack of communication cannot.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-02-17T18:30:56Z	Beware when booking connecting travel	We've used Eurostar a few times over the years, and apart from a few delays, have enjoyed the experience.  Our opinion has been changed after our recent experience of booking a journey.A couple of weeks ago on 27/1/20 I made a booking for a journey on 28/3/20 at 8.31am from St Pancras to Moutiers.  I understood that I would have to change stations in Paris and assumed that the Eurostar booking system would factor in enough time to make this journey.  It has given us 55 minutes to get from Gare du Nord to Gare de Lyon.After conducting some research into the time that it takes to make this transfer it seems that 55 minutes is very tight, other websites recommend a minimum of an hour or more to make this journey.  We'll have ski gear with us so taxi is the only option.  According to Waze and Google the fastest car ride is 20 minutes (in Paris traffic it could easily be more).  On top of this we'll have to queue for a cab and get to the platform and on to the train at Gare de Lyon.  (We are already near the front of the Eurostar so we can get off quickly)  This timescale will only work if the Eurostar arrives exactly on time.  I see from the Eurostar website that it is not unusual for trains to be a few minutes late.  If we miss our train at Gare de Lyon there is no other direct train with availability that day- we can wait four hours and then have two changes.  We paid for a direct train from Gare de Lyon.There is an earlier Eurostar train on 28/3/20 that leaves St Pancras at 7.52am and arrives at Gare du Nord at 11.25am.  This gives 1 hour and 22 minutes to travel between stations, which seems much more realistic.  This earlier train was not presented to us as a choice when we were booking (we searched St Pancras to Moutiers on the Eurostar website), if it had been we would definitely have chosen it.I see from the Eurostar website that there would be a charge to change to the earlier train.  Given that we were not given the option of this earlier train when we purchased tickets it seems unfair that we would have to pay this fee.  I was in touch with your customer services via email the day after making the booking to see if there is another way the ticket can be changed to avoid the first day of our holiday being ruined/stressful.  They still haven't got back to me.  We booked the Eurostar as we thought it would be a relaxing, fun, environmentally conscious way of making out trip, instead we have been put in the position of very possibly missing our connection or paying £80 to change to a train we didn't know existed.  I see from a 2017 article in the Telegraph and several travel blogs that these short transfer times have been negatively impacting journeys for years, yet they haven't been sorted out.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	2

2020-02-17T18:30:56Z	Travel Only If You Really Must	Travel Only If You Really Must . . .Well, it’s a convenient way to travel from Paris to London, although I’m increasingly drawn to the bus, and I suppose they try hard, but for Pete’s sake, why on earth is it so difficult to get your suitcase into the carriage?   You would think, after all this time, that Eurostar would have realised that there are Oldies in this world and that they have to travel sometimes and that lugging a 15 kg suitcase up these damned steps is just a tad difficult.   I realise that the designers got it stuffed up from the beginning — because, after all, it doesn’t take a genius to work out that to have a same-level platform and carriage entrance is quite a good thing for travellers — but you might imagine that in all these years a solution would have been worked out.  But no, you get in the carriage, totally out of puff from lugging the case up the stairs, then find, of course, that you’re at the wrong end for your seat. This always happens.  And once you find the seat, in cattle-class, of course, because that’s the only way many of us peasants can afford to travel, you realise that Friar Torquemada of the Spanish Inquisition was but a beginner in inflicting discomfort.  Who designed these seats?  Could I introduce him/her/them to those who designed the seats in the Paris to London buses, which are so comfortable even after nine hours of travel? One thing, tho :  while you’re waiting to be called on board, the seating at St Pancras and Gare du Nord is so sparse and uncomfortable that it does make you want to get on the train as soon as you can.  There’s usually an upside to every horrible experience.  And the upside to travelling in cattle class Eurostar is getting off that darn train.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Booked eurostar for 2 adults and a child under 5 (they knew the age since i had to enter date of birth) at booking, and gave gave seat allocation only after payment complete. Shocked to learn that all of us were seated in differnt parts of the train. the child was give a seat out of sight and unsupervised. Having phoned customers, showed no concern or sympathy. they said speak to the station manager on the day to see if any other customers travelling would give up a seat on good will, if not, im afraid theres nothing else we can do.how can they expect to allow a child under 5 to sit on his own, unsupervised and out of sight of his parents. staggering that they have no concern/responsibility of the safety of a child! due to this response, i do not feel safe travelling and cancelled my trip. lost around £800 for nothing!Updated: I emailed eurostar 3 days ago as they said they were concerned about my review. so far, no response. I dont think they are concerned and there was probably no point in sending them an email. They just write these comments on here for show. actually, it is evident that nothing is then done about it.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-02-17T18:30:56Z	Lovely way to travel, but an expensive monopoly	I love being able to get to France by train, and Eurostar trains are solid and dependable. Just wish they weren't so expensive.Plus, so many people jump on the wrong train or sell their tickets on the black market - yet no-one on the train or on the way there EVER checks your ID against your ticket. Guess if they sorted that out they could offer better prices, wonder why they don't?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3
2020-02-17T18:30:56Z	Disgusted and just theft!	Disgusted!My daughter turns 17 in April and together with her boyfriend they booked their first ever trip away on Eurostar to Paris combining it with a 2 night hotel stay. This trip was booked some months ago but sadly the relationship has failed and she is left with non-refundable and non-transferable tickets and hotel booking. Her elder sister is now travelling with her and so I appealed to their better nature to see if out of good nature they could change the name on the ticket/hotel booking and we would pay any admin fee. The short answer is they won’t entertain it at all and state we have to make a new booking for her sister. Now how hard would it be just to allow a name change for a fee, instead they want their cake and eat it making us book another seat whilst knowing the original seat will be empty...pure theft is all I can say and hardly inspiring young travellers to ever use their service again. For the Eurostar executives, hope you enjoy your fat cat bonuses from ripping off your customers and for setting the benchmark for customer service at the absolute low point.After contact by Eurostar I can confirm the matter has been resolved it was just a pity it came to making a public complaint!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

If you try to claim back costs through a cancellation be prepared for a long protracted dismissive response. After receiving an badly worded reply from Eurostar Customer Services. I then tried to complain to their CEO Mike Cooper only for one of his minions to respond without taking reading my complaint. This company don't care about customers problems Needless to say the Eurostar train doesn't take the strain or resolve customer problems	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-02-17T18:30:56Z	Can't provide basic customer service	I haven't used eurostar for a number of years, in part because of poor service. Recently I thought I would give it another go and travel to Amsterdam and back. Before I made a booking, I wanted a question resolved. Accordingly using the web contact form, I submitted the question on 17th Dec 2019 and received the usual automated acknowledgement. No further reply, so I wrote again on 10th Jan, again an acknowledgment but nothing further. Currently after SEVEN WEEKS I still have not received the courtesy of a reply. In the event I made my trip by air, even though I would much preferred to go by rail.Congratulations another lost customer!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-02-17T18:30:56Z	Dont expect customer care	If the eurostar works its great, otherwise its not. Customer care is non exhistant. Our train was 58 minutes late (2 minutes outside compensation).

2020-02-17T18:30:56Z	This was a mistake	We have been “randomly” assigned seats with no view on all three trains. Every carriage has only four rows of seats with no view, so to get it on all three trains is not only unacceptable, it’s basically impossible to have been a random event. We certainly paid enough money to be given at least one half decent set of seats! The lovely view of Europe has not been experienced at all. It was the whole reason we took the excruciatingly long (and expensive) journey from London to Amsterdam by train. Add to that some unacceptable delays, awful connections, a connecting train with an incorrect departure time, tickets that wouldn’t allow us through the barriers, and confusing information for passengers in Brussels. It’s the first time I’ve taken Eurostar and it will most certainly be my last. I repeat what everyone else is saying: just book a flight!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

The website does not work, a variety of error messages appear after entering my details and proceeding to the checkout.I've emailed eurostar and their response was ""clear your cookies and use google chrome""If it wasn't for the fact that I don't really have another viable way of travelling on these particular dates, I would have given this up as a bad job and booked a flight.I have travelled with eurostar twice in the last year and have successfully booked through the website before, now its just broken.Been on hold for 20 minutes, trying to talk to someone, absolutely pathetic."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-02-17T18:30:56Z	Random erros and faults with the website	"The Eurostar website seems to be random w.r.t. whether it is working properly or not.  I frequently try to get a fare between London and Paris or London and Amsterdam.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it fais with some cryptic error come up.  E.g.:""Sorry, we can't complete your search at the moment. Please try again later. (ERROR: SEARCH_825). CID: PKG-FKR68-QMYRF""Whatever that means.  So a couple of days ago I searched for a return fare in June, going out Friday, coming back Sunday and got a price.  I didn't book it right then.  Went back today and it says that because of a strike there are no trains on the Sunday.  Huh?  What if I had paid for the return a couple of days ago? For an organisation the size of Eurostar, they need to get someone who knows how to run a simple website like theirs properly.I think I'll fly or drive.  At least I know I'll get there and back albeit with slightly more hassle."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	2

2020-02-17T18:30:56Z	Not the most helpful, stick with the plane!	Booked my wife in standard premier from London to Thonon-les-Bains and a week later decided we would all travel down a family, i book the other 5 of us on the app and my mistake booked standard by mistake, immediately realising what I had done I called customer service explaining my mistake and to see if they could sort it out, spent nearly a hour on the phone in a very confusing call  to be told on top of the upgrade price, we would also have to pay £40 per person admin, so another £200, he said he could see my wife's booking and it was obvious a mistake had been made, he also said he would speak with his manager to see if they could waiver the admin fee, to no avail so it looks like we will be travelling as a family on the train separately with 4 children.   It wouldn't be so bad if it was only to Paris but we are then changing onto the TGV for another 5 hour journey.   Please use some common sense Eurostar, we normally fly down to our house 2/3 times a month and this will be our first experience using Eurostar, also our last!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

I have never complained in my life before but feel so frustrated with the sheer incompetence of customer service.My train to Bruges was cancelled in December due to the strikes which is obviously no fault of Eurostar. I requested a complete refund and was told it had been credited to my account.This did not materialize and despite numerous calls to customer service each taking over an hour they still said it had been refunded. When each person I spoke to and each email received telling me different dates of the refund I realized know one had a clue where my money was and it was left to me to keep chasing. I finally got a response when I sent a public tweet and a copy of my statement showing no refund. I have since asked for some form of compensation for my inconvenience and surprise surprise no response !!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-01-18T15:55:28Z	Customer Care doesn’t care	6 November I booked and paid £276 for a return journey to Bruges for two people in early December. Booking reference QRVRER. 27 November Eurostar emails and texts me to say our return journey on December 6th is cancelled due to the French strikes giving me a web link to an online application for a refund, which I did for two people, plus booked flights home. 3rd December Our outgoing journey was delayed, again I was emailed by Eurostar Customer Care saying I could apply for compensation, (working out at £27/person). Which I did and for two people. 4th December Whilst on holiday in Bruges Greg Barr at Eurostar Customer Care emailed me to say my 6th December return Eurostar train was not cancelled. I immediately replied to him with the 4 screen shots of the texts and emails I’d had from Eurostar saying it had been, plus a screenshot of that days Eurostar webpage saying it was cancelled. I heard nothing back. 11 December Back home. Email from Eurostar Customer Care confirming my Eurostar tickets (for some reason) and a tiny bit of text at the bottom saying they had refunded me £168 on 11/12/20 BUT THEY HADN’T AND DIDN’T. 23rd December an email from Eurostar Customer Care saying I’d be refunded £27 for the delayed outward journey, which they did. BUT WHY FOR ONLY ONE PERSON WHEN TWO HAD APPLIED?23rd I emailed Eurostar Customer Care with full story and asking for the rest of my money. 24 December. Eurostar Customer Care emailed me to say they were refunding me a FURTHER £108. Why FURTHER, I hadn’t had anything yet! Why only £108 and not the £168 + £27 I’m owed?24th December I emailed Eurostar Customer Care with the full story and asked for the rest of my money. No reply. 2 January 2020 I emailed Eurostar Customer Care to say I’d been refunded that promised £27. I also gave the full story and asked for the rest of my money. 4 January After no reply I emailed Eurostar Customer Care to say my patience was running out. I also gave the full story and asked for the rest of my money. 4 January £108 refunded to me. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE MONEY £60 + £27 = £87. 9 January After no reply I emailed Eurostar Customer Care, gave the full story and asked for the rest of my money. I said “This is all getting rather stressful I can't count the number of emails I've had to write to you, and the number you have sent back to me all saying different things. I am not at all happy. So you still owe me £27 + £60 = £87, please refund me? And now I would also like some compensation too please for having to go through this non repayment nightmare?”17th January Absolutely no replies from Eurostar Customer Care and no owed money.I have also tried phoning Eurostar Customer Care but the wait is so long you give up	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-01-18T15:55:28Z	***Update, Eurostar did read the review and did resolve the issue, disappointed it did not 1st or 2nd time around but it is resolved. ****** very poor customer services and a strategy to lose business	Very poor customer services and a company who obviously does not care at all any longer about loyal customers or long term customers. I have travelled with Eurostar literally since it started 25 years ago. Was on the frequent traveller program since the days you used to fax them proof of travel to get points, before their current program. Effectively on program without gap for 25 years. So a long term frequent user. In Oct they tell everyone that the criteria for Carte Blanche has gone up, my program expiry was in Nov. I was already on track to stay on program but they moved the goalposts literally giving me a month to take travel I had not planned or be removed from the program. I could understand if there was decent notice, if my expiry was Oct I would have been on program for another year but as it was nov I was removed from the program due to being just a few points short of the new higher target. I called customer services to explain the odd expiry and ask if there was anything I could do eg transfer points from another program etc and was told no it had to be points from travel. So I had a few weeks to try to resolve it and book a journey.  I could not and would have acted inappropriately had I booked travel that was unnecessary just to get the extra few points needed. The amount was very small. The fact that I faced a new target just before my renewal date was irrelevant to them and re the new target with no notice I was told sorry nothing can be done, I wrote to them as well explaining the odd situation and was told pretty bluntly that no they could not uplift me to the status I was on without taking the appropriate amount of travel. It was as if they had ignored the case and treated me like I had never travelled before. That’s no way to treat customers who have travelled frequently and spent huge sums of money over several years, in fact literally since they started. Since Nov I have had now had 4 journeys into Europe which previously would have been with Eurostar none of which I have now taken with them. I am still travelling just via other routes now Eurostar still have seats available so it seems to me they just lost a good customer for what?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-01-18T15:55:28Z	Rip-off	Took the train to travel more environmentally friendly and paid 2,5 times the price for a flight. Only to be charged another 34 euros for my skis at the station, despite luggage restrictions never been mentioned during the booking process. When I complained about this, I was told in an extremely patronising way that there were luggage restrictions on other trains too, including the ICE. Sorry lady, I'm German and have been using ICEs my entire life, frequently with skis, and never heard of such a thing. Guess my first time on Eurostar will be my last one, too. Charging for luggage on trains is a disgrace.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-01-18T15:55:28Z	I might have been luckier than others	I might have been luckier than the majority who have posted here.   Most of my journeys have been trouble free and enjoyable. My main negative point is that some of the trains are dirty and scruffy with filthy toilets,  but this is rare.Onboard staff generally are particularly pleasant and helpful and I have seen them go the extra mile when confronted with difficult situations, and to show real care and concern when a child sitting near me had an allergic reaction to something she had eaten.  On another trip a group of louts from a major British business consultancy boarded the train drunk at Paris Nord carrying glasses of beer.  They got drunker and louder and more abusive as the journey progressed, throwing food, beer cans, and foul language around.  They also talked loudly and inappropriately about the well-known client they'd been to see in Paris.  As a result of my complaint, they were quickly contained by security staff and offloaded into the hands of the police at Ebbsfleet.  Onboard staff took contact details for other passengers and we were all sent a letter of apology and a lovely hamper.Boarding at Gare du Nord is a dreadful experience, although I believe it may have improved recently. The French security and passport control staff are surly and unpleasant, a contrast to those at St. Pancras.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4
2020-01-18T15:55:28Z	Eurostar = awful customer service	Eurostar = awful customer service. On Friday the 13th (Unlucky for us) December four of us had our seats booked together for our trip to Brussels. Unfortunately when we arrived at Ebbsfleet station & passed through the turnstiles we each received a yellow slip of paper to inform us that our seat allocations had been changed - we now had two seats together & two people sitting in isolation.Initially we raised our dissatisfaction with the customer services lady who told us nothing could be done as the changes were due to a change of train with different seating layout. We then spoke with her manager (Louise Vincent) who said that the changes were made by colleagues in Lille & she couldn’t change them. We were offered a refund but of course this was of no good as we had hotel bookings that were too late to cancel for a refund!!!!!Eventually the manager said she would check for any ‘no shows’ once the train had left St Pancras & that she would come to see us in departures with an update - She never came to provide an update.Whilst in the departure lounge we raised our concerns with further staff including the operations manager who suggested that we speak to the train manager who may be able to help. We weren’t able to sort a change of seating out so had to travel separated to Brussels - not a good start to our weekend away.Whilst on the train I raised a case with Eurostar customer services for which I received an acknowledgement straightaway but three weeks later no actual response.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-01-18T15:55:28Z	The experience I’ve had with Eurostar was an absolute disgrace	The experience I’ve had with Eurostar is the worst service I’ve ever experienced travelling in my 44 year’s. We booked allocated carriages and seats and we were told to just go to a carriage and sit anywhere. Not ideal for families travelling with young children. The lack of procedures, information/instruction was an absolute debacle. There were Poor families struggling to find seats, resulting in placing their child with strangers and having to stand in the baggage area. Absolutely disgraceful. The Rudeness of Eurostar staff is also completely unacceptable. Not assisting anyone with basic enquiries. Just barking orders down to the passengers.  Never using this service again. Would much prefer to pay 3 times more and fly than experience this ever again. An absolute disgrace.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

I know this is surprising to give FIVE star in that context. Please bear with me. The team, in Brussels, handle that in the best way ever. They find me another train and booked me a room in a hotel straight away with NO fuss. All the team have been pleasant and keen to help me before I ask anything. In 10 minutes, everything was sorted out. I am very thankful to the whole team who show the highest standard of professionalism. Keep going, guys, you are great. You made my day :-)	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5
2020-01-18T15:55:28Z	French strike - Efficient but long to answer	Following the train of my parents being canceled by the french strikes I called the customer service to exchange the tickets. I waited for about 40min - the annoying thing is you have no estimation of where you stand in the queue or how long you need to wait for. Once the CS answered, the lady was really helpful and changed the tickets quickly.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4
2020-01-18T15:55:28Z	really good customer service	I had to use their customer service a few times and every time the waiting time was much better than any other company such as BA or Virgin.Also, the staff have always been very helpful and trying to resolve the situation. That includes the staff on train. Sometimes the trains run into troubles e.g. delays or cancellations but it looks this is more realted to the train infrastructure in Europe and UK rather then the comapny itself	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5
2020-01-18T15:55:28Z	Terrible Customer Service	Made a train + hotel package booking through Eurostar for the 16th - 19th December. Got an email from them days before informing me that our train has been cancelled due to strike action.Following the instructions on the email I submit and refund request. A week later I get informed that I will received my refund. The amount quoted is only for the train ticket and not for the hotel, which is a joke if I am being expected to pay for that considering the cancellation reason was due to means outside of my control.I am currently writing this review while trying to phone customer services. I have been on the phone for 50 mins and still going. Despite saying I need to speak to someone regarded packages I have been passed on twice to people who do not handle this so I have been constantly passed around and being on hold etc.Worst Customer Service I have had the displeasure of having to use	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

What a disgrace you should do something about that Eurostar !!!!I am completely furious.

The email had the option to request a refund or rebook for free, however the functionalaty seemed to be having problems when trying to re-book on later train (I assume because there were no longer any seats next to each other).Called up the number suggested by the error page on website, and after 40 mins on hold, we were given tickets to the next train no problem. Call lasted less than three minutes, with good customer service.In summary, 5/5 customer service, 2/5 phonecall hold waiting time (although appreciate the whole train was probably calling), 3/5 website (get that error fixed and it would have been the ideal experience)	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4

2019-12-07T11:29:46Z	Just off the phone with customer servuces...	Just off the phone with customer services, rescheduling a trip due to them cancelling my outbound train (strikes in Paris). Couldn't do it on the (usually excellent) app for some reason. Ok, it took 30 mins to get through; they must be innundated. But once through the agent immediately identified the issue - I had part paid the ticket with a voucher/promotional fare so it was being funny about me moving it -  she did it for me in 10 seconds. While Eurostar could do with more resilience in their call handling - I doubt this will be the last strike in France! -  their staff are really helpful. I travel regularly with them and  find the service is generally excellent, especially at the St Pancras end. Gare de Nord can be a bit hit and miss. And why don't they have trays to put your stuff in for security like every other international security operation I've ever been through?! The number of times bag straps jam in the conveyer belt must be frustrating! i don't know if Eurostar provide that service themselves - if you do, please sort it out! Last time a confused gentleman picked up my coat!  Ok, so they are not perfect. But I am giving 5 stars for the customer service, the people who try to sort things out for you, and are generally great.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5
2019-12-07T11:29:46Z	Wij werden gezien als fraudeurs en moesten 427 euro betalen dankzij Eurostar's erbarmelijk controlebeleid...	On Friday the 22nd of November we took the Eurostar in Brussels without any trouble. However on our way back home on Sunday the 24th of November, we arrived 1 hour before departure but weren’t able to pass through the first ticket-control at St Pancreas.When trying to check-in we were told other people got through the gate with our tickets (same name and same reference numbers). We were seen as frauds! When showing our ID’s, the Eurostar staff could verify we had the same name as the names written on our tickets. We had to wait for the police to arrive, but they never showed. In the meantime, we had to buy new expensive tickets, because there was no way we could get through the gates otherwise.We don’t understand when going through three different control gates, nobody checks if the name on your passport/ID matches the name on your ticket. Apparently re-selling your Eurostar ticket is illegal however nothing is done to control this.If the staff would have checked if the names on the passports matches the names on the tickets, this situation could have been prevented. Besides, we bought our tickets on the official Eurostar website.We made the Eurostar staff aware of our situation and concerns, we asked them if they could check who sat on our original seats so we could reclaim our seats but never got any confirmation on this, instead they obliged us to buy new tickets.Other than that, we expected a lot more from the Eurostar customer service. They doubted our honesty while we showed them our original tickets with our matching ID’s. We simply don’t understand how such a big and important company shows so little support towards their loyal customers.Apart from buying a new ticket, never were we told any kind of solution. Instead, the ‘fake’ us got through the gates with our tickets with our names, while we were left behind with frauded – non-valid – tickets and the obligation to buy new ones.May we mention that on every Eurostar ticket, the Ticket Conditions state: ‘This ticket can only be used by the person whose name appears on it’.We would like to be refunded for our tickets, as this is something we are not responsible for and could have been prevented by a better Eurostar gate policy.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-12-07T11:29:46Z	Consistent and appalling chaos during queueing at Gare du Nord	The reason for this rating is the queuing experience at Gare du Nord.The lack of organisation, or rather chaos, is staggering, and unfortunately common. Staff keeps shepperding customers in absolutely random queues, constantly changing their order.The resulting waiting time, for two people arriving at exactly the same time, can vary from 10 minutes to an hour, which in many cases resulted in a missed train. Such improvisation, for the routine and daily process of organising queueing, reeks of amateurism from the Eurostar staff and generates unnecessary stress, even resulting in quarrels among passengers over the random ordering of the queues, without the staff bringing any sense of authority or order. This is again unfortunately common in Gare du Nord departures, and I hope Eurostar takes this opportunity to better train their staff and implement a clear process for queuing.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-12-07T11:29:46Z	Brussels signage non existent	We have just returned from a trip with friends to Bruges Christmas market and travelled from St Pancras on Eurostar. As this was our first trip to Bruges, let me make my first main point - Eurostar does NOT go to Bruges, it goes to Brussels and then you are on your own how to get to Bruges and back.The signage is abysmal in Brussels and locals agree that the old British Rail is a shining example of helpful customer service when it comes to the Belgian equivalent. As we alighted the Eurostar in Brussels we could not find one sign helping to find a train to Bruges. In fact, a wall mounted timetable indicated a two hour wait, but an information kiosk found quite luckily said “5 minutes over there on platform 9” and we were away!Perhaps we were just not trying hard enough and hoped that the return journey would be better having experienced the outward journey, but no, it was worse!. Arriving in Bruges for a return train gives no help for travellers going back to Brussels hoping for the merest mention of a Eurostar related train. We found out that Brussels has several stations, north, south, midi and others but Eurostar give no indication on your ticket purchased in the good old UK which one to head for. Several trains go every hour to Brussels, but watch for the letters IC to give an idea of which will connect to Eurostar, but even then the signage in Brussels for Eurostar in the main railway station is non existent. We googled Eurostar Brussels platform which indicated 1 and 2 as the best bet and headed in that direction to only confirm by reading one tiny departure board that we had found our correct departure point at last and headed with the crowd to Terminal 1. Wow, what a horrid depressing waiting area that Eurostar has for its standard class of customer. Only those able to wait in the Premier Business Class area looked remotely like a well treated and welcome customer and I guess most will have been paid for by our EU Brussels comrades rather than those of us looking for anything other than mouldy dog eared food from the only food outlet and tasteless tea and coffee.This was a depressing journey and will not be repeated. Bruges is a marvellous place to visit, but don’t be fooled by Eurostar into thinking that they get you there and back because they don’t and your ticket should give you the clue when it says London St Pancras to Any Belgian Station!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2019-12-07T11:29:46Z	Terrible staff	This was my first trip on Eurostar and after this trip I'm not in a rush to use them again.Going from London to Paris was perfect, had no issues and the train and staff were comfortable and friendly.But coming back was a different issue, me and my family checked in early and they said the train was changed and the seats were reallocated, they then offered me two sets of 3 seats, I complained asking how is this, i had pre booked this due to my young kids and how can it suddenly be full, as we were early, I said look around the train for better layout, the eurostar ticket worker, had a quick look then printed 6 tickets out and left the booth to replaced a bloke, the tickets didn't look right and asked the bloke in the booth and he said they were fine.I went through the passport booth and the relooked at the tickets, the tickets now had my entire family scattered around the coach, the nasty female worker had intentionally placed my under 10 kids on their own around the coach and her replacement had lied.I went to complain to the Eurostar help desk and after watching them sell other tickets to other commuters and then treated me like dirt when I complained.My wife then went and complained, but was reduced to tears by the sheer arrogance of the Eurostar workers, I then complained in the phone to Eurostar and that was to no help.It was only due to the kindness of people on the train who were willing to swap sets that my under 10 year old kids were not sitting with strangers.Never trust any of the Eurostar workers in Paris ever.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-12-07T11:29:46Z	"Eurostar defines ""atrocious customer service""."	Chronic delays, inadequate compensation, no apologies apart from a standard well-used piece of insincere text.

Information given to us on board lacking, no food provided (other than a mini sized kitkat bar and plastic cup of water). Final compensation we got for this inconvenience was a 75% refund in form of a Eurostar voucher. Absolutely embarrassing compensation after the inconvenience we had to sit through. I sent a complaint to their customer service, took a full week to get a generic reply that they would give no more than the voucher worth 75% of our original ticket price. Unfortunately the horrendous service we experienced during our travel got extended by their very poor customer service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

I saw a few customers nearly have a “punch-up” in the queue to which the staff just walked away, rather than owning the situation.I did ask one member of staff if today was particularly out of the ordinary, to which he replied that is was a normally busy day.The management should be thoroughly ashamed of the lack of service they provided.

2019-12-07T11:29:46Z	Deteriorating service	i have used eurostar for many years now but now try to avoid travelling to France. The service has got worse and worse - poor and limited food options, more frequent train delays and no -empathetic announcements, new trains which even the staff say they hate, ridiculously high prices and costs of changing tickets, insolent staff at St Pancras and Gare du Nord, huge delays recently in Paris, a Carte Blanche system that I've now been locked out of as a result of increased points needed as it was 'too successful', and I could go on.At the start, this was a wonderful service, but eurostar seriously need competition as I think it may go out of business soon without some sort of competition.

I'm a carte blanche member.A few weeks ago, they changed the program and decided that members had to spend 33% to keep it. It started in October for everyone so if your membership is due for renewal in November like mine, you don't have time to get the points in unlike if your renewal is in sept 2020. In my case, they tell me I have 3 weeks to spend £600. I'm not the only complaining about the situation (have a look on twitter).After calling them, they showed zero empathy and kept telling that I had accepted the legal conditions (!).The fidelity program keeps getting worse, points are now useless. When you talk to them, it's always for the benefits of their customers. ""We charge you more cause we really care about you"". I don't even use the business lounge, the only useful advantage when you're a carte blanche member is using the fast-track lane. Queues are so long without, it's depressing.Treat your loyal customers with respect and empathy. Fix your issues:- wifi is a joke, we're in 2019- the food is terrible on standard premier and the quantity is not enough for a grown up man- trains are frequently late and dirty- they overcharge you for everything when you want to reschedule a tripEnjoy your monopoly while it lasts!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2019-12-07T11:29:46Z	Travelling back from Disneyland resort…	Travelling back from Disneyland resort Marne la vallee / chessy . After 4 fantastic days what a shambles on Eurostar. First told to turn up over a hour before. Then no one knows what happening ? For over a hour finally after looking on our phones we find out our train has broken down no Eurostar personnel to tell us . Over 300 passengers trying to get through check in the lift is lock so have to carry our buggy down flights of stairs . Now train turns up late and it a free for all everyone like us who had paid for premier seating are told it a different train so anyone can sit anywhere. So out of 7 of us all split up also no food what we had paid for this is how to run a Eurostar service basically  no one could be bothered to stand by the doors and check tickets you had family separated !!! Then told we can claim just go on Eurostar compensation as I paid for seven people on standard premier can I get my money back lol ... it saying we are not recognising your claim what a joke !!!!and now three times I’ve ask for compensation and they keep asking for my new ticket as I said before my train broke down it was a stand in train a free for all anyone could sit anywhere. Please Eurostar I would like my money back for standard premier not to just be ignored!!! We traveled on the 19/10/2019 from Disneyland Paris at 1655 but didn’t leave till 1800 ...Just got of the phone to Eurostar WOW just been told there is no evidence of us not being able to sit where we were suppose to sit and basically telling me I’m a liar , and have a 8 pound e ticket to spend on Eurostar.This is how a company works takes over 1000 pounds for all my family so we can sit together in standard Premier for a train to break down and told to sit anywhere but your get compensated, then to be told you won’t as there no record of this and your are liar we will never travel this way again a firm that can keep your money even if they do not provide a service . 300 pounds out of pocket well done Eurostar 👍	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-12-07T11:29:46Z	Terrible experience with Eurostar as…	Terrible experience with Eurostar as usual now. They even don't have a proper WiFi. Only their advert is big. Absolutely no WiFi connection most of the journey.Not to mention that even don't go to Disneyland. You need to change at Lille Europe for TGV. That's rediculus.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-10-15T16:03:24Z	fabuous service!	Have just done a round trip from St Pancras to Eurodisney on Eurostar with my 88 year old mum who is in a wheelchair. Can not fault the service at all. There was always someone to take us where we needed to be, escorted onto train, ramps in place and staff absolutely lovely. Bit ‘laid back’ in France on the way back, but the job was done smoothly. England definitely the most organised - can’t thank you all enough. No stress - great service!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5

Name not checked at all on tickets though so no need to rebook a ticket if this happens to you. * Poor booking system - I believe caused an auto correct mistakes. I accidentally booked two tickets under my name instead of my name and my boyfriends. I believe it could have been an auto correct error as I spoke to someone on the phone who said that had happened previously. Euro star did not allow me to change the ticket name. I had to book another ticket that cost £189 plus £10 phone charge. Either their booking autocorrection error (I think this was possible) or I made a stupid mistake that I was charged a lot of money for. Users make mistakes and Euro star should be more considerate of that in their terms and conditions. Very disappointing user experience. Unless I get a refund (or part refund) I will never use again. But I feel that they do not care if I use it again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2019-10-15T16:03:24Z	Eurostar's booking system glitches…	Eurostar's booking system glitches leads to customers paying exorbitant amounts for its errors.  I bought a return ticket London-Brussels for 22/08/19 on the first and last trains of the day. However, when I went to scan my return ticket on that day I was told the ticket was for the last train the next day on 23/08/19. I felt gutted and ashamed and being extremely tired because of the very long day trip, with no much battery left on my mobile and with the pressure building up because time was running fast to get the train I wanted, I decided to exchange my ticket for the one I needed and paid 182.50 euros for it. This was a huge blast to my poor economy as my original ticket was £29.I thought about it and concluded that this wasn't my mistake because when I booked the tickets around 21.05.19 I was looking for the cheapest and earliest journey available and I first checked on 4th August being one day after my birthday, however it was more expensive and at the end I had to take the 22nd August for being the one fitting with those plans. However, I decided to double check because I had seen some prices changed at one point on my search and I went back to check 04.08.19. To my surprise the price was what I wanted; £58 and after double checking everything I clicked on buying.When I received the confirmation email the date booked had changed to the 22.08.19 and I thought 'oh, there must have been a system problem', however, I left it there because I had already tried all possible dates and the first available one for the price I wanted after 04.08 was 22.08. I never checked the return date thinking of course that it had gone back to what I had chosen first; to go and come back on 22.08.19. I never wanted to stay the night in Brussels because I didn't want to pay for accommodation, that means I never ever looked at any ticket after the 22.08. knowing the least I could pay was £58. Under these circumstances I don't feel is fair I had to pay for this ticket, I'm very sure I didn't made a mistake as I'm very careful when I book tickets being experienced on travelling with Ryanair. I take time and double check every piece of information I need to fill or confirm. As I say above I booked for 04.08.19 and I received an email with a ticket for 22.08.19 and returning on 23.08.19, I never looked at any return ticket after the 22.08.19, so how could I have got such a ticket? After complaining to the company and getting help from  London Travel Watch, Eurostar refuses to offer any refund or compensation, and there are other people in this page that have experienced similar issues in August. How does Eurostar defend themselves when there have been so many glitches on their system on those dates. They argue that as I got an email with the confirmed dates I am the one to blame, but how good is that when the problem is that their booking system doesn't work properly and makes mistakes that customers have to pay for?Furthermore, we as humans make mistakes for many reasons and Eurostar acting so harshly and taking advantage of passengers' misfortune is cruel and corrupt. They make a fortune selling tickets as they're the only company offering this precious service particularly now that climate change is an emergency and they still punish customers this way. This is brutal and should be made illegal, a mistake should be penalized with a low fee and in the cases I'm talking about it is not even the customers' fault.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2019-10-15T16:03:24Z	My advice don’t use Eurostar to travel	My advice don’t use Eurostar to travel! I lived a horrible experience and it’s not the first time. I had a train to Paris at 17h01 on Friday 04 of October 2019, I arrived at 16h25. There was a huge queue for the security control. So I asked to a Eurostar agent to cut off a little the line because I was a little bit afraid about the time. He told me : « No, we have closed the gates for this train. You have to go to the ticket office ! ». I replied that I didn’t understand as the trains was at 17h01. He told me « gates close 30min before, go to the ticket office ». But I arrived 30min before! This agent didn’t have any common sense. I noted this agent then let some customers cut off the line but they were women. It’s unacceptable to be treated differently just because I’m not a woman. The queue for the ticket office was huge because some trains had been canceled. After waiting 30min, an agent asked me : « how can I help you? ». I replied : « I had a train at 17h01, I arrived at 16h25, but an agent told me that the gates are closed ». She told me : « you have missed your train, due to trains canceled we close gates strictly 30min before ». I said : « No I didn’t miss the train I was here strictly 30min before, it’s incredible that I am held responsible for canceled trains. It’s not my problem. I take Eurostar quite often, And got trains even by arriving later than the time I arrived today». She didn’t reply at all about my concern. She just repeated what she said before. She told me : « we close gates strictly 30mins before. I will check availability for the next train. You will have to pay 44£. ». I was shocked to be asked to pay for new tickets when the issue was due to train cancelled by the company! She left, then came back after 5min. She asked me to pay 44£ then told me : « you can go to the queue for security control, your train is at 18h01 ». I call that racket! Tickets are already expensive, I payed over 200£ for these tickets and I had to add 44£ because they are useless and some trains are cancelled. Again my advise don’t take Eurostar !	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-10-15T16:03:24Z	eurostar don’t vet their hotels	Eurostar state on their website that they review their hotels. I booked a train and hotel package.

Contacting customer services was a challenge and they stated they were not responsible for the hotel which later they agreed was incorrect.

I have taken the Eurostar for many years. The same day several others had the same problem.The station workers while sympathetic, had no leeway for reducing the outrageous penalty fare. I was obliged to buy a 386 Euro ticket in addition to the one I had already bought, months before.I was told there may have been a techinical problem, they would contact me. They did not, After many mails I was informed they could unfortunately do nothing, as I had had a ocnfirmation mail with the wrong destinations indicated, This is Vulture Capitalism at its worst; heartless and extortionate.

2019-10-15T16:03:24Z	Would rather fly with EasyJet	Booking the tickets was a problem from the beginning. The date selection is very buggy on the site and this caused me to select the wrong return date for my journey. I didn't even realize this until trying to return home. Eurostar then wanted me to pay £300+ to change the ticket dates for myself and my girlfriend. Instead we left the station to book flights through EasyJet the next morning to get home. When trying to get a refund for the return tickets that we didn't use, Eurostar refused and said it's their policy to not give refunds.The train itself felt very compact. I'm a tall person, but even on my commute to London on the high-speed I have plenty of leg room.

Could learn a massive amount from the Shinkansen.Reply to Eurostar comment: Thank you for the response but the fact that you only reply two weeks after I posted the review tells me all I need to know. I won’t be taking you up on your offer of further information...just walk around and look for yourselves. Ask your staff who work in these areas. Then have a bit of a refurb.

Sadly our car was at Ashford, so highly inconvenient especially late at night with children and luggage.Secondly, I do feel the toilets in the Eurostar waiting area in Paris deserve a special mention! Like something from the third world, floor in a disgusting state, toilet roll everywhere, bins overflowing, suspect substances on the cubicle walls, toilet itself looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. Inoperable, dirty looking taps, mould round the basin, filthy tile surround. Not enough soap dispensers, hand dryer not working.

We had first class InterRail tickets which allowed us access to premier class seats on Eurostar. We had to reserve seats, which cost £33.50 per head. We managed to change reservations for an alternative inbound station when our plans changed. We were changed only £10 to do so even though T&C suggested we'd have to pay full price for reservations again.Everything went to plan. All trains were on time. There are insufficient seats in the pre-boarding area and on the trains the air conditioning was inadequate in the tunnels. However, the charging points worked, our vegan meals arrived as arranged and were very good. Generally very civilised and comfortable.

2019-09-18T16:58:20Z	Worst train experience in my life	Worst train experience in my life. We took the train from London to Brussels and wanted to reach a connecting train to Germany. The Eurostar was late and the crew made a wrong announcement about changes to the subsequent connecting ICE during the ride so that around 150 people were not able to reach the ICE. My girlfriend even went to the train staff to double check their information as there was other information on Deutsche Bahn App. Instead of taking any measures to help the stranded people, including families and children, Eurostar didn't do anything, changed their arguments of defense several times, and called instead the police staff to help closing their terminal. Finally they did blame Deutsche Bahn for not being able to communicate properly and one of the managers even shouted at the crowd of 50-60 people to shut up. The only help was to advise to book an hotel on our own cost and to take any train the next day. Thanks for nothing. Never again	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

What levels of incompetence are needed to tell passengers that the queues are due to ‘busy period’ = holiday season, hardly a surprise, pretty easy to predict and react to.  Which executives are willing to fix this, and which ones should be fired for allowing this to happen? When will you realise that most of the promises made to customers are broken - NOT hassle-free, NOT convenient, NO LONGER cost effective, NOT stress-less...Are these problems recognised? Will they be fixed? If not, i’m Happy to switch back to flying, and would suggest that if it keeps going this way, that the last person out switches off the lights.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-09-18T16:58:20Z	Small things could make a big difference	I do not like to fly so use Eurostar at least annually. I like trains and am happy to travel on them but it costs much more and takes significantly longer than air travel - so why don't train companies do more to make travelling by train more inviting? Particularly at a time when people are becoming much more conscious of their carbon footprint. Eurostar in particular has things going for it but ... Most recently I got the 'direct' service to Avignon. I called Eurostar but was simply referred to their website by someone who sounded like it was really too much effort to speak to me and they were clearly eating as they spoke. On a separate occasion, another less than enthusiastic person couldn't help with questions about the timing of their own services or of local trains so advised me to use Trainline! I did - and sucessfully booked all required tickets including the Eurostar trains I wanted. The service to Avignon was busy (as they all seem to be which surely is a positive that should provoke more change?) and is indeed direct in that you don't have to change in Paris or elsewhere but it stops en route. We arrived way ahead of the recommended time to go through passport control/security for the 07.19 train from St Pancras but it was chaotic with large numbers of passengers boarding trains all departing around the same time. (It is an altogether much smoother and more pleasant experience from Ebbsfleet but the service we wanted did not operate from there). The process was very slow and despite the extra time we had allowed we pretty much only just boarded our train on time with very little opportuniity to grab food/drinks for the long journey. On board offerings are totally over priced and inadequate in every way possible. Why don't they just sub contract to Pret a manger or similar? Also, why do they say there is free Wifi when there simply never is? Over the years there seem to be less staff on board and none of them I saw this time were particularly welcoming and once seen were then invisible barring litter collectors who appeared once in both directions and were great. We had to stop and disembark at Lille on the return trip for passport control x2 and security which no one tells you about beforehand (the tickets tell you to arrive at least 45 mins before departure for security etc - which we did - but this was unnecessary because there is no security at Avignon). Again, a laborious - but I accept necessary - process and all staff involved were excellent. The trains were exactly on time which was great and made up for a previous occasion when we were left stranded in Paris with an armed policeman at the Eurostar information point and not a member of staff in sight! I want to travel by train - and I have ventured as far as Venice so far - but nothing much ever seems to be done to make it an altogether more conducive experience. I know Eurostar is only one part of this but they could do much more in leading the way.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3

2019-09-18T16:58:20Z	Travel chaos but immediate refund	Was due to travel Brussels to Ashford last week but read about the chaos caused by extreme heat on overhead cables, so booked an overpriced last minute Amsterdam- Gatwick flight instead.   Was going to write to Eurostar to explain why my ticket not used and ask for part refund, but as soon as I typed their ticket number on to the web page, a notice came up that I was entitled to a full refund, and a voucher for this amount arrived the next day.   OK it was not cash, but I use Eurostar regularly,  so the voucher was fine. At least Eurostar acknowledged the travel chaos, which was probably not their fault, and offered immediate compensation.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4

I was told that in fact my train will not be stopping at at my destination (Brussels) and will terminate at Lille. Completely understand that these things happen, but the lack of communication was appalling and I was also told conflicting information of where I can get my connecting train! Which had me walking aimlessly round Lille for over 2 hours. I have received a email informing me that I will receive a partial refund has my train was 132 minutes late. Even though this was the case, they have not taken into account I arrived into Brussels FIVE hours later then planned!! Which surely should be taken into account as the service I paid for ( which was not cheap) was a direct train from London to Brussels!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

The only option was to change to the next day at 6pm. We are now trying to get a refund for accomodation and private car tour prebooked! The cancellation was not showing on the departures board.

2019-07-27T06:19:22Z	For your own best seriously dont buy	Honestly from Bruxelles to London it was rly good. Nice food, nice staff that talked politely to you but from London to Bruxelle. Jeez! The train was delayed with 2 hours. Yea 2! Already from the start when it havent even began to drive yet, they said they were 40 minutes late. Then it evolved into almost every 20 minute the train stopped to take a break. None of the staff said anything about why! Also the food was more like snacks. It was so small even the drinks. Dont buy a ticket for this train. It advertises with that its better than a plain, but its rly not! Unless you wanna support trains who believes they have the right to not tell their passengers why they are 2 hours delayed dont buy one of their overpriced tickets!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Journey to Brussels extra leg room,and breakfast on a tray.Juice,Coffee,couple of Pastries.Paying this much glass of Champagne or Bloody Mary would have been expected.No newspapers.Return journey after fabulous holiday in Masstricht,same leg room though evening meal was very nice considering the catering constraints spoilt only by the attitude when i asked for another 125ml bottle of wine.So looking forward to travelling Eurostar particularly so called First Class.NEVER AGAIN.Maybethe well over paid boss should experience it.OOPS no he is probably flying first class.Overall complete waste of money,next time we will fly.TERRIBLE!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-07-27T06:19:22Z	Just get a flight!	I am only giving one star because zero stars is impossible. The review relates to the customer 'care' team, rather than the trains: I never even got to make a booking. What other company specifies which internet browser you have to use to make a booking with its website (Google chrome only), then has problems with the website itself and tries to charge you a telephone booking fee when you ring them up? What other company keeps you on the phone for half an hour while the dopiest call centre staff imaginable has to check no fewer than 12 - yes 12! times with their 'manager', who by the way couldn't be bothered to come on the phone himself? I booked a flight in the end. I gather this company is failing economically. It will deserve its fate.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2019-07-27T06:19:22Z	Quick, reliable and environmentally friendly way to travel	I travel Eurostar London to Brussels three times per year and have always found the service excellent, reliable and the journeys relaxing. The website is easy to use to book tickets, you can change your assigned seats if you prefer, and you can check for delays via live departures on their website. When there are problems I have always found these dealt with efficiently. I received an email last year when my train was cancelled due to weather related damage repairs and was able to book onto the following train within half an hour using live chat. All those passengers who arrived at the station not knowing about the cancellation were rescheduled onto the next train in a quick and well organised manner with no queuing, I was very impressed. Surely people booking bargain non- refundable tickets without travel insurance must know by now what this means, so I find the poor reviews complaining about inflexibility unfair. Also, yes it is NOT cheaper than flying, but why should it be? I travel by train because I care about my carbon footprint and because I find it much more relaxing. I find Eurostar trains are safe, quick, comfortable and mostly on time. Unlike air travel, they get you into the heart of the city. Last time I arrived in London I caught my onward train at Waterloo within half an hour of disembarkation. You won‘t achieve that landing at Gatwick or Heathrow!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5

Having contacted customer services, we were offered either 25% off another Eurostar booking (basically a way from them to secure future bookings),or a cash refund. Upon accepting the cash refund, we were told they had made an error their end and should never have offered the cash option. Awful customer servicing and no attempt of an apology.

You must make sure should book the correct dates and times as you cannot cancel your tickets. Even if they are booked months in advance. You can refund tickets if you buy business only..... Not to worry!! They will let you Change your journey!! But this just seems like a scam. It states that it the price of the ticket it more it will cost you more. So you’d look for journeys which would be cheaper, but there isn’t any. You pretty much just have to buy bother set of tickets again.This just seems so strict and poor for service.

Fellow passengers looked in disbelief and stepped in to help. While eventually passing through security she continued shouting repeatedly ""next time you pack your bag lighter so you can lift it"". Pretty disgusting when I have just told her I have an injury and physically, can not lift. I was so embarrassed and almost in tears not to mention furious. It was abusive behaviour.

2019-05-26T19:24:31Z	EUROSTAR ARE NOT GOOD TRAVEL AGENTS!!	We recently travelled to Lyon on a package booked through Eurostar having booked the weekend including hotel . The first problem occurred in the transfer from Gard du Nord to Paris Lyon. Thier timings do not leave enough time. You need at least an hour and a half for the tranfer time due to taxi queues ( we are pensioners and cannt deal with the metro) and the ongoing road works at Place de la Bastille. Eurostar gave us 40 minutes. Thanks to a brilliant taxi driver who almost drove us onto the platform We got the TGV with a minute to spare which left us completely stressed.The onward ticket from Paris Lyon ended at Lyon Par Dieu. Then we paid €20  to get to our hotel. Which was 100 yards from the next station that the train called at!!!! We only discovered this when our hotel receptionist told us when we tried to book a taxi to go home. Our seat was booked so we were able to get on at Lyon Parrache. Why did Eurostar not know this?We booked a superior room at the hotel Charlemagne. Eurostar booked us a regular room. The hotel were happy to change us however.We will travel Eurostar trains again as they are the easiest way to get where want to despite thecstinking toilets. But as a travel operator we can do better ourselves.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3
2019-05-26T19:24:31Z	Drunkenness common on Eurostar	"On Thursday, May 16, 2019, I traveled with my family from London to Brussels on a 8:55 AM Eurostar train (which was 73 minutes late departing). During this trip, we had a terribly uncomfortable experience involving 5-6 men who chose to hang around the cafe area drinking rounds of beer and chatting about highly inappropriate topics so loudly that the entire coach could hear them at 10 in the morning. You'll see from this video that one of the men asked another if an acquaintance's ""tits are real"" to which he responded, ""yes - oh I speak from experience"". You'll also hear them saying the f word at least 3-4 times. You'll notice that this is only two minutes of their conversation, but I'd be happy to fill you in on the other 60+ minutes, which included their blowjob experiences, how their penises felt during these experiences, their sexual encounters with various women, and at several times, loud banging and demeaning comments towards women and gay men. I estimate they said the f word more than a hundred times between all of them. As they were hanging around the cafe area with an automatic door, it was inevitable that the door opened numerous times unnecessarily and several of them made it a point to make uncomfortable eye contact with me - I'm a petite woman who was sitting with my parents and boyfriend by the cafe area.The man serving them at the cafe area did nothing to ask them to quiet down their conversation or move the area, though it was clear they were being very inappropriate among children, families, and the elderly. A member of our family would have asked the man to kindly ask them to leave, although due to a similar experience the day prior, we were forced not to as it wouldn't make a difference (while traveling from Paris to London, there were men hanging in the area speaking very loudly, and we told the man at the cafe, and he told us to get up and move; we then told the train manager and he said nothing to the guys at the cafe but instead moved us to another coach and separated our family, so it's clear telling staff we were uncomfortable only had staff place the blame on ourselves as staff cannot control 6 drunk men). We would have also kindly asked the guys to quiet down, but they were becoming more drunk and we did not want to make a scene with irrational men - we also asked the guys in the previous day's trip to keep it down but they laughed at us and kept on more loudly with their conversation.This trip made us feel helpless. We did not pay hundreds of dollars to have to hear conversations like this from people being served beer after beer to have staff just allow it without the consideration of an entire coach. People from other seats in the coach kept looking back at the cafe area and were clearly offended. I'm sure some were even scared to go into the area surrounded by 5-6 aggressive drunk men, I know as a petite woman, I was. It was an extremely uncomfortable experience that clearly your staff did not want to do anything to remedy. I'm deeply saddened by the experiences I've had on my first Eurostar trips and will consider alternative options before ever choosing Eurostar again. I will also be sharing this experience with my friends and family so they can reconsider traveling with Eurostar if these are the types of experiences you allow on your trains."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

I've had several poor experiences with Eurostar the worst being them taking unauthorised payments from my credit card that took 8 phone calls, talking to 8 different people to sort out.Now it is pretty much impossible to buy tickets online. You get to the payment authorisation stage and every time, every single time, they say they can't take payment.So I called to find out why. The reason? You have to use certain particular browsers in order for the website to complete the authentication process. Firefox is no good, Safari is no good. Apparently it has to be IE (!!!) or Chrome. So they know this, but they don't say that anywhere during the purchase process and just let customers flounder through their antiquated processes.So I've had enough. I'm just gonna fly between London and Paris now even though the actual train service is really quite good. I can't buy tickets using browsers that every, single, other, company I deal with online has no problems adapting to, and in addition the awful online and telephone customer service, I'd rather put my money elsewhere. I'm done. Too much disappointment with this online joke.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

That's right, if someone else pays for the last tickets at that price before you have managed to enter your payment details, they will get the tickets and you have to go back and select more expensive ones. EVERY OTHER WEBSITE I HAVE EVER USED HOLDS THINGS IN YOUR BASKET FOR A TIME UNTIL YOU HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO PAY. NOT EUROSTAR!

Most of the staff are lovely and friendly, they have great accessibility especially as I have a disability which limits my mobility. They're always helpful and it's nearly always a positive experience. If booked in advance it's not too expensive, and you only have to be there 45/60 mins before the train leaves. Honestly could not recommend enough, especially as a frequent traveller as you get points which add up to free trips after a while. You're always informed of any (very rare) delays and compensation is easy if things are delayed dramatically.

2019-05-26T19:24:31Z	Great company but please get back to basics	Eurostar is a fantastic company, they're clearly very customer centric and genuinely care about their customers - many little details, throughout the journey, are a testimony to that: good looking trains, comfy seats, lovely free magazine, quirky (cash) bar selection, etc. And for those who can afford an upgrade the standard premier service is very attentive.However... While it's great to be looking forward as a business and pushing some very fun marketing, they seem to forget sometimes about the basics of their product, which is disappointing.For instance:> the queuing system in Paris Gare du Nord is la merde. I appreciate the added security, etc. This does not explain why the parked crowds are so poorly managed. I have witnessed, on several occasions team members contradicting each other, or just not enforcing their own instructions, resulting in a waste of time for literally dozens if not hundreds of people.> It would be good also if the trains could be a little cleaner. I appreciate that said trains are in high rotation and there's a lot of traffic, but when you pay an average of £150 in standard class for what remains, for all its bells and whistles, a train journey, I will argue that it's reasonable to expect that train to be clean?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3

2019-05-26T19:24:31Z	What has happened!	What has happened! Having travelled with Eurostar on the snow train and having had a good experience I was expecting the same on the relatively short London to Paris route. On Saturday 20th April 2019, my young daughter, husband and I arrived in plenty of time to catch the 16.04, on which we were booked. I asked staff upon my arrival at the station and seeing the large crowed already, if we get through, they assured me we would. It was 28c in Paris my young child needed the toilet but had to hold on,we had no water and nobody explained what the delay was. We had to queue for nearly 2 hours to get through check in and security. People were pushing and become frustrated, the staff in the station did not handle the crowed well. My daughter who is only young felt frightened and extremely anxious about missing the train. When we finally got to check in we were issued another ticket, being told the train configuration had changed. Then announcements were made that they were holding the train, a relief as we were rushing back for Easter holiday dinner with our family that evening. However when we finally got through to the platform area at 16.23 there were no staff, no announcements, no information at all!!! We were left to rush around (including a young boy who was travelling on his own!) and guess as to where our train was?I approached a desk and was greeted by an extremely rude member of staff who curtly told me the train had gone and then ignored me! I was eventually seen and booked onto the 17.07, therefore making my original departure over 60 minutes delayed. We given no explanation, no apology just another seat where my husband had to sit separately to my daughter and I. Who by now was in tears after her ordeal and then finding the train had not waited and that she was going to miss her family Easter meal.I am applauded at the terrible customer service that we all received at all points with Eurostar.We missed our family meal as our connecting train did not tie up with our original arrival time and this is something you cannot change, sadly.Finally when I tried to log onto the system to claim a evoucher for the delay I was not able to! This has really been the last straw!Why would you treat customers in this way?Now I see from the many, MANY appalling reviews of the company that the fact they have still not got back to me regarding my complaint (even though their policy clearly states they will in just 2 working days!) this should not be a surprise. In this day when we are looking for better ways to travel Eurostar should be a beacon. I shall be calling on the government to seriously review why this company still has the contract to run this service. They clearly have little regard for customer care, professionalism or product development.Have decided to follow this up with my local politician, as its local election time!'Resolve' website also has some good information and worth looking at (can't post links sadly).Finally I will be in contact with the ORR.We can't allow these companies think they can treat us in this way! i work really hard for my wage, my family mean the world to me and holidays are supposed to be a happy, relaxed experience...well not if you travel with Eurostar!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-05-26T19:24:31Z	Avoid if you can	First=it is pretty expensive. For the price I paid I can get half of it and take the flight to CDG. On board service is not really what I was expected. First if our coach is in 1 or 16/17/18... you will have to walk to coach 6 or 13 to get your drinks. Secondly, our ticket cost £243 rtn for 2 hrs route...let think again...For an emergency yes will do it but if you have time to take alternative option I suggest you do so...	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-05-26T19:24:31Z	Avoid if you can on route Paris	Avoid if you can on route Paris - London as you will be held in a queue by rude people with zero crowd management skills. Huge delays from the French side and lack of adequate information or apology.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-05-26T19:24:31Z	Shocking service	Shocking service. Train was cancelled and at no time were we notified of the cancellation until we asked what was happening. They said they cannot advertise it as cancelled! We asked what was happening, they said they don't know. 3.5 hours later they found us a ride back to London. They never announced anything in English it as shocking.The security man was extremely rude and intimidating and on a power trip! I guess when your company has no competition you can do what you want and nobody cares!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	6 (SIX) HOURS ON HOLD WITH EUROSTAR! SIX!!!	"Where do I start? There are 3 types of companies: good, bad and Eurostar. They are not just a bad company with poor (or non existing) customer support. They are something much more than that! I am not going to go into details, just a simple fact: I called them at 10am today and have been on hold ever since (the time now is 13:30PM) - THIS MAKES IT 3.5 HOURS ON HOLD! And counting... That is neither Euro, nor Star dear Eurostar. I just read that the world record for staying on hold is 15 hours. I am slowly but surely getting there! 12 more hours and I will beat that! Hold on Guinness, the new king is coming around midnight!""Thank you for holding. We'll be with you as soon as possible"" - now this phrase is stuck deep down inside my brain... HEEELP! Yes, Happy Easter to you too Eurostar!UPDATE: I have managed to stay just over 6 (SIX) hours on hold. I have taken a screenshot as well - in case someone does not believe me. Have you heard of anything like that before guys?"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	Horrible experience	If I could leave zero I would . Most of the complaints on here are about price , cancellation and general poor service . Mine is much deeper . The whole experience  is horrible . We travel a lot to Paris , Rome and other European cities for pleasure . We have always flown . Went to Euro Disney for Easter weekend and thought we would try Eurostar The journey is rocky  and bumpy , the train also tilts to one side for long periods  . The train keeps  slowing right down , then speeding up . Also stopping and starting . Held up for 20 mins because of signal problems or because a train ahead is stuck in a station . The air con on the train is useless , the air in the train is stuffy and putrid . Within 20 mins of leaving all the toilets are filthy and the suction flush stopped working  . You have to walk though loads of carriages to get to the snack bar and there the tea and coffee is disgusting with almost no choice of snacks . On a plane. The speed is consistent and  barring the odd bit of turbulence it is smooth ,  the stewardess brings you a drink , the toilets are continually cleaned , the air con keeps the air so fresh , many people ask for a blanketA flight to Paris takes 55 mins. our journey home with Eurostar took 4 hours . Then there is the price , it is cheaper to fly All in all a horrendous experience , tried it once . Never again Forgot to mention , anybody thinking it is like a normal train with more leg room than a plane , forget it . Seats are the same as a budget airline company . Same leg room	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	I went on a Eurostar train recently	I went on a Eurostar train recently. It was very good value and the journey was excellent. The waiting room was fun to be in and the boarding of the train was handled very well. It was a very comfortable train. The journey was a pleasure. Communication in the run up to the journey was excellent. I was updated on the journey times and printing the boarding pass was no problem whatsoever. Eurostar were brilliant! Very close to five stars. if you have not travelled with Eurostar for a while I would suggest travelling with them and being impressed as I was.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4
2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	I used to like Eurostar but this year…	I used to like Eurostar but this year they've been cancelling trains left right and centre and the experience has been dreadful. And the new e320 trains are awful, they have a horrible fidgety ride quality, the toilets are as likely to be out of use as working, the Wi-Fi is rubbish and they are already starting to look a bit shabby. I have reverted to flying as I just got sick of the experience.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	Absolutely disgusting	Absolutely disgusting. I feel so sorry for all the people that got left behind today, who waited for more than 2 hours.

2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	SHOCKING DISREGARD OF CLIENTS	SHOCKING DISREGARD OF CLIENTSI travelled on the Eurostar to Paris then Lyon. It was during the work to rule in early March. I was due to return on the 8th March but at midday on the 7th was texted by Eurostar to be told not to travel on the 8th due to disruption. I went onto the internet site and booked a return for the same day. I had to lose a day's holiday and re-pay for a new trip from Lyon to Paris. The rest of the story is too horrific and long to state in full. Anybody that travelled on the 7th from Paris -shunted like cattle to Lille-then arriving early the next morning in St.Pancras will know how we were treated by Eurostar.My complaints were initially ignored by their customer services so I wrote a registered letter. It was finally acknowledged telling me it was basically all my fault that I chose to travel back immediately. It was my fault I chose to cut short my holiday and I was only entitled to a small rebate in the form of a voucher for further travel on Eurostar. Firstly I would never again travel on these crowded dirty trains paying for the privilege of being treated like cattle. Secondly to anybody reading this, think very very carefully about travelling on the Eurostar. They do not care, customer service is non-existent and you will have no rights whatsoever in case of disputes. The service is poor and will not improve as staff is completely un-interested. French Customs will increase industrial action until the Brexit question is settled. AVOID PLEASE	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	Staff are fine, its the leadership team who are the problem	Mike Cooper and his  leadership team in Eurostar are the problem with Eurostar. The train product is good, but customer service is poor. This isn't the fault of the agents on the phones or staff in the trains, they do not create policy or rules. 30% of job titles in the Eurostar leadership team have 'customer' in them, unfortunately this is just a parody of reality, contemporary management speak. Being customer driven is really hard, far easier to be mediocre and take advantage of a route dominance. My business travel experience mirrors many of these one star reviews, a shame as Eurostar really could be great and really should be better.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

I am flying from LAX to AMS where I was planning on taking Thalys to catch the Eurostar in Brussels. I didn't know the train from Amsterdam CS stopped at Schiphol when I booked. I have been trying to change the ticket to no avail. I now will have to hurry into Centraal just to catch a train in the opposite direction. I was told if I try to board at Schiphol my ticket would be void and I would be refused boarding. I asked to upgrade my ticket, no again. I may just walk away from the $302.00 ticket with Euroscare and take a flight direct from Schiphol. This is the most ridiculous organization I have ever experienced in all of my travels. How does it stay in business?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	Stay away from Eurostar	Stay away from Eurostar, do yourself a favor a travel another way. We spent 8 hours waiting for a train, missed a tour and what did Eurostar offer $57 for future travel.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	Cold, Uncaring and no compassion	I got seriously ill and was unable to travel.

2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	You are better off flying	I am not for flying - but the service is so poor with Eurostar that it's much better to fly. At least your tickets is easier to change with a flight than with Eurostar. Especially if you have some emergency, they are completely out to earn last minute fare. The customer service line is rude and long waits. One Eurostar customer representative even told me that if I think it's too expensive, I can take the bus and boat to London. This is a complete monopoly that they just can't care anymore.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	Terrible customer service	Echoing other reviewers here to say simply dreadful customer service. Was caught up in disruption at Gare du Nord on Sat 30th March and, as a direct result of wrong advice given by Eurostar, wasted £300 on alternative travel arrangements. Raised this with customer service but no refund, and not even an apology!But I suppose when you have a quasi-monopoly on the route then you can treat your customers however you please; there aren't exactly any other cross-Channel rail services to act as competition...Even given the extra time needed & high environmental impact, I would seriously consider flying for my next trip in order to avoid Eurostar's bad service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

There was one guy there and all he said was the train was canceled and there was nothing he could do.He didnt give us options. We were left to figure it out on our own.That is something that would never happen in the USA.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	An absolute joke of a company	An absolute joke of a company, shame I can't give it 0 stars. Not offering any type of customer support. Booked a trip to Paris and on the very same day turned out one of passengers can't go so we will take someone else instead. Contacted them immediately - they can't do it! You have to rebook the whole trip for 3 people (pay around £700) and then they will kindly issue a refund for another £700 worth of tickets you originally bought. This will only take around 28 days to reach your account! Wouldn’t it be easier to just refund 1 passenger’s ticket or change a name (I would be ok to pay for it) ? –This company have to be either acquired by Virgin or someone else. For the people who had as bad experiences as me you can put a complain through official site associated with MoneySavingExpert, it goes directly to Eurostar (not that they responded to me at all, it has been 10 days now!). Here's a link : www resolver co uk Maybe if we all flood them with complains they finally wake up - or is it just my wishful thinking....	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	Racism aboard Eurostar	Hey Eurostar team,My name is Paul. I am a frequent traveller on the Eurostar. I live and work in Amsterdam but all my friends and family live in London. I travel with Eurostar almost weekly. Usually with exceptional service and professionalism.   However last nights journey was anything but that. I had booked a standard premier ticket returning to Amsterdam from London. I boarded the train as soon as possible and took my seat. It was a seat located at a table of 4. It was a relatively empty carriage and I was eventually joined by 3 other people. I had the isle seat. The lady that was meant to be sat next to me asked if I could change seats with her as she wanted to be opposite her husband. I kindly obliged. Then the lady opposite me asked if I could move seats as its an empty carriage because she too wanted to be sat opposite her husband, once again I kindly obliged. I noticed behind me that there was a cabin that was empty in the same carriage I was sat in. So I sat there. After a slightly chaotic start to the journey I was finally sat down relaxing in my premier seat. This is where things took a dramatic turn for the worst. About 40 minutes into the journey 2 members of staff informed me that I was not allowed to be there. They had given me no explanation at this point. They had not checked my ticket, they just very aggressively said I was not allowed to be there. After asking what was happening the train manager came rushing into the small cabin shouting furiously at me. Telling me I had no right to be there. Telling my I don’t belong there. He then screamed at me to get out and sit in my original seat. I gathered my belongings and proceeded to return to my original seat that I had kindly given up so a woman could sit with her husband. Upon returning to my original seat I started speaking to the lady that was sat there, the train manager then started shouting at me telling me not to bother the people that had paid to sit in premier. I was very confused at this point. The lady serving the food told me to just take a seat in an empty chair. So I did. They continued to serve the food but they failed to serve me. After about 5 minutes the train manager and the lady serving the food proceed to point and have a very aggressive conversation in french about me. From the little French I speak. I understood that he was instructing her not to serve me as I didn’t “belong here”. They eventually checked my ticket and realised that I was in fact meant to be there as it was the ticket I paid for.   I was treated with the utmost contempt. I was made to feel humiliated and treated like a criminal who had snuck his way into the premier area.   I can see no other reason as to why the train manager would have treated me like that other than racism. All he saw was a young brown male with a beard and instantly cast judgement on me. He deemed that “I didn’t belong and that I wasn’t suppose to be there.”  After about 10 minutes I asked a member of staff as to what the train Managers name is. She informed me that “she did not know”. The train manger then aggressive approached me and asked why I was looking for him . I informed him I would like his name as I would be putting in a formal complaint. He told me his name is Wim and refused to give me his second name or any other means of identifying him. It was not until after Brussels where I noticed the crew had changed I spoke to a different train manager. I told her the situation and she was appalled by what had happened. She apologised and gave me the information I needed. The train manager that racially profiled and discriminated against me was called:Wim Train 9150Train from London to Amsterdam 5:19pm 24/03/2019.Best, Paul	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	Worst return trip ever	Unfortunately  that was my worst travelling experience  ever,  I ve been waiting in a queue for 5 h,  just to be checked and let known that every train to London is suffering from serious delay. imagine waiting for nearly 5 hours with no access  to any sort of commodity.  Terrible  experience from Paris  to London.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	Terrible	Three hour delay on my way out from London to Paris. Cancelled on the return and no availability to travel the same day. The most terrible service due to French industrial action. The most hopeless county in Europe for business! Avoid!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	Avoid, Avoid, Avoid!!!!	The only reason there is one star is because zero stars is not an option.Absolutely terrible post sales service.  We need to change our booking but the trains are full back to our original station so I need to speak to someone about getting a train to Ebbsfleet as it is not possible to change this online.  I have now spent over one hour over the course of the past 2 days on hold waiting to speak to someone in customer service, still waiting at time of writing.The cancellation insurance is only available in the most narrow set of circumstances which of course is not made clear on booking. Appalling, appalling service.  Its a while since I used Eurostar but it seems as though the entire service has gone dramatically downhill.  I'd rather fly to Europe and I hate flying......	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-04-22T12:39:18Z	I would never recommend eurostar	I would never recommend eurostar. I got two tickets for almost 200dolars from london to paris, but i got them from a company named goeuro, i biught the tickets the 1st of january travelling the 3rd of march 2019, the 22nd of february i got an email from eurostar saying that they had a disruption and had to cancelled my ticket, the offered me to exchange or get a refund for my ticket, they never answered my exchange request, and the told me i had to ask goeuro for the refund. But eurostar had to cancelled their trains because of a disruption they had, go euro didn’t cancelled my tickets. I had to buy two more tickets for 500dolars because eurostar didn’t reply to my exchange request, and now is the 1st of march and i couldn’t get any refund from neither of the two companies and i’m out of 700dolars	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-02-26T10:37:00Z	Appalling will never use again	Appalling will never use again. I refer to a Delayed journey of 74min from King's Cross to Paris.First of all, the service is atrocious. When we arrived at King's Cross at 1.00am from Coventry for the 5.40 train (later train not possible due to lack of overnight services) we found no waiting area and it was probably one of the coldest nights this year. This is unacceptable to 65 and 66year olds waiting on a metal bench in the freezing cold for 4hours. We both ended up with severe colds and flu for our holiday. Then we missed all our connections down to Genova in Italy and ended up staying overnight in Turin thanks to SNCF who ensured our safety, as there was no other train to Genova until the following day. Then when we went to book our return with Eurostar the prices were ridiculously high so we took the ferry from Calais which was a delight. Needless to say our experience of the Eurostar will not happen again as we won't be using it!Not only should they refund the entire ticket but they should pay compensation for the stress we endured.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-02-26T10:37:00Z	Bad customer service,	Take the ferry, take the plane, anything but the train.   That should be their logo.Do NOT trust them.    They will call you liars and deny everything,  that is the customer service policy.   And they, or JOSH will refuse to give out full names,  so you cannot complain about them.     The service is lousy.   You will arrive more stressed than if you'd chilled out on a well organised ferry or plane.     It is appalling.   Look at the number of BAD reviews FIRST.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-02-26T10:37:00Z	Take the ferry	Normally a pleasant experience, despite the ridiculous prices however this time I arrived to the check in (which was completely empty) half an hour before departure only to be told, boarding had shut a minute ago and I was immediately directed to the next train and charged 100 Euros! As a student, I simply cannot afford this and while I accept company policy and that I was a little late (thanks to Metros), I have arrived ten minutes before departure in London before (due to some sad unforeseen circumstances) and the staff were sympathetic and polite and let me straight through. Did not even ask for an explanation! However here in Paris, customer service lacked completely, they simply charged me a hell of a lot of money for the next train, despite being early enough to watch my original train board from the gate area but no longer being allowed to get on. Sorry Eurostar, I am NOT happy!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-02-26T10:37:00Z	Money Hungry	Travelled from here to Paris for the first time. Was on my own and I’ve never met such rude and unhelpful staff. The contrast of my experience with the staff in Gare du Nord was very obvious. They were friendly and helpful. It has put me off travelling from st Pancras again. Next time I’m getting a plane	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	2
2019-02-26T10:37:00Z	Rudest staff I’ve ever encountered	Eurostar website showing my train tomorrow at 6am cancelled - no email or call to notify us and the train is not listed as cancelled on their twitter feed. But we can't check in, we can't print boarding passes BUT they won't give us a refund. Honestly this company is the worst ever. They should be stripped of their monopoly position and replaced with an ethical, competent company.Thanks for a great start to the half term eurostar! Having no train at all is at least a change from the usual broken toilets, reassigned seats 3 carriages away from our children and massive unnecessary queues at security as they aren't properly staffed.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-02-26T10:37:00Z	Avoid Eurostar	To be honest I wouldn't even give it a 1 star if that would be possible!I never so such a service  in my life.  Trains were cancelled 1 after the other due to poor weather conditions  in France LAST week, although I travelled YESTERDAY  from Belgium to London NOT France! Then obviously trains are jammed packed.  Try to avoid them where you can.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2019-02-26T10:37:00Z	Paris Gare du Nord Eurostar. Awful Manager Nicolas!	Paid over £300 for two standard premier return tickets to Belgium. Unfortunately my wife developed a medical problem that meant we couldn't travel, as we were waiting for an emergency specialist appointment. Tried to rebook the tickets, but Eurostar wanted another£300 plus. This would have meant the total ticket price would have been over £600 !!! Tried online chat, no movement there. Sent two complaints via their own form on website. No response..... Shameful shameful service and treatment of ill people. Do not use these two-bit cheats, use the ferry.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-02-26T10:37:00Z	Shame on you Eurostar	The new CEO, Mike Cooper formley of Yodel, which explains a lot, is turning Eurostar into the rail equivalent of Ryan Air.My family and I were late for our connection due to our previous train being delayed by 3 hours. Eurostar charged us almost £900 for four new tickets. If that wasn't bad enough they even charged our two children adult prices, they said that all the children's seats had gone, how you run out of children's seats on a train I have no idea!!!! I would have been quite happy to pay a small rebooking charge, but £900, shame on you for treating passenger's in this way. I have used Eurostar for over 10 years and have been late for trains before, on those occasions my family and I were simply put on the next available train,  so BEWARE, not any more. At least Dickk Turpin wore a mask.Take my advice and fly if at all possible.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2019-02-26T10:37:00Z	Usual 'let's pick on a white normal…	Eurostar refused to refund me the ticket I couldn’t use because I had a medical emergency (cancer) and couldn’t exchange the ticket because they only sell tickets for the next 6 month, while the chemotherapy courses and rehabilitation takes longer.

2019-02-26T10:37:00Z	Cancer? Not a reason for refund	First time I've used this useless website. Tried to book a one way ticket from Paris to London, clicked the 'when - depart/return' box - nothing happens!  No calendar offered. Tried 'live chat' - gives me a link  - which doesn't work either!  Tells me to use a different browser!!  It works OK for planes and UK trains, why not for eurostar? Hopeless.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-02-26T10:37:00Z	First time I've used this useless…	Shocking returns policy, this company has 0 interest in its customers.£30 refund fee per ticket - there is no logic behind this charge. What difference in cost is there for Eurostar when I change my booking?No refunds policy except for Business premier ticketsNo refunds when the train arrives late.Why would I book tickets from a company that cannot guarantee they will be on time, will pay you nothing when they do a mistake but leaves you no options when you make one?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-02-26T10:37:00Z	Shocking returns policy	OK I made a mistake. I booked a train from London to Paris instead of London to Lille. It was a silly mistake. I had been booking different journeys and making different searches and I got mixed up. As soon as I pressed the button to buy I realised my mistake and FOUR (yes four) minutes later I called Eurostar hoping to get a simple rectification.Would the customer services person issue a simple refund so that I could go back in (online) and make the same transaction a few minutes later? No chance. I was told that I would have to pay a £10 fee and they would rebook my train and any difference in fare would NOT be refunded.The rebooking took forever. Now this is NOT the first time I have done this.  80% of my purchases are done online so I am bound to make a mistake here and there. But every other company I have dealt with has, without flinching, refunded my money immediately if I have called then within the house and I have gone back in and purchased the correct fare straight away. And Im talking the likes of Virgin Trains. British Airways. German Trains dB. Even LOT airways (who have some pretty terrible customer service). But not Eurostar. It took an email to customer services, their press department and some top bod a few days AFTER I had paid the fees to get my money back. The way the letter was written, I was meant to feel grateful that they had made an exception. Blimey.And to be honest, it wasn't really the money. It was the principal. I vaguely remember reading somewhere that there is a cooling off period for online purchases. However, forgetting that, surely all companies should put into place a 'common sense' period. If a customer calls up four minutes (or even an hour or so) after mistakenly booking a product online (eg a ticket), it is obvious it is a mistake and common sense should prevail. It wasn't until i saw eurostar's 82% terrible customer service score did I realise that many others were no happy with the way the company deals with its customers. Maybe they should have a serious rethink. Or maybe they need competition on the cross channel rails to wake them out of their slightly arrogant customer service slumber	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-02-26T10:37:00Z	Awful Mistaken Transaction Policy & Even Worse Customer Service. 82% awful can't be wrong	Very bad customer service. Rude reply to emails. Website crashes constantly. (Watch out for this error code which I've noticed appears over the last few years whenever I try to book a cheap ticket - it's as if the cheap tickets are just there to attract buyers and then they whack up the price once they've wasted your time choosing travelling dates and times: (ERROR: SEARCH_825).CID: BPA-PKC5H-CWQAQ)The toilets on the Eurostar are filthy and don't work. When you flush the toilet you get blue water splashing up at you - ruined my white shirt! Often run out of paper or are totally blocked (that's before the train has even left the station).Pricing is terrible - why should a ticket cost £300 if somebody wants to travel at short notice or buy it at the station, when they sell others for £29. Ridiculous!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-02-26T10:37:00Z	Very bad customer service	Rubbish service1- Euro 220 for Ashford to Paris day return = expensive2 - tried to change my return trip to earlier time - they wanted e200 to do that - almost as much as the full fare. It was same day just go back at 4pm instead of 8pm! Did not pay out of principal.3 - at check in got a Eurostar text to say now not STOPPING at my stop Ashford4- their staff said no that's not right but it turned out it was.5 - there was some change of train so seats got reallocated with a bright shiny yellow tick - complete FU - people had the same seats6 - don't need the same painful apology six times over an hour to say the same thing - not stopping at Ashford.7 - the review about the UK security channel is 100% right - no trays for the xray machine and no smaller trays for change, watches etc - there are a couple of little plastic tubs fixed next to the walk through scanner and its absolute mayhem if its more than a couple of people - DO SOMETHING TO FIX THIS STUPID ISSUE - the staff look at you as if the customer has a problem.Overall a pathetic and expensive experience. I will avoid at all costs in the future.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2019-02-26T10:37:00Z	Eurostar - a complete mess and pain in the rear end	I booked a first class return with Eurostar to travel between London and Annecy which included travel on the SNCF french trains.On the return from Annecy I noticed that I didn't have seat numbers on my tickets and when I got on the train I was told the train was full and that we would have to stand for the entire journey to Paris. I have just raised this with Eurostar and they said its not their problem and that I had to complain to SNCF. I find this amazing so my advice to anyone thinking of buying a ticket for anywhere further than Paris with Eurostar - DON'T!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Hello, I am terribly annoyed by the fact that there is no trays to put bag, coast, suitcase etc in Paris Eurostar Station at the police control. My belongings keep getting damaged every time on travelling on my way back to London. All customers are complaining about it.... what is Eurostar waiting for to put some trays in Paris Station? Getting plastic trays in Paris will be less than 200£, which the cost of my Paris-London ticket... Could be a great move to finally get these trays in 2019.

2018-12-28T19:58:51Z	Worst service ever!!!!	Booked our Christmas trip Amsterdam to London on Eurostar.  I guess they use Thalys from Amsterdam to Brussels, go through customs and switch trains to Eurostar to London.  Not sure why they put us on Thalys?  Thalys was delayed so we were rushing from platform to Eurostar.  Our family of 5 were told we missed the train and would have to wait 2 hours for the next one.  What??????  Seriously??? The lady ahead of us with 2 kids made the train and we were the last ones through.  How is this our fault?  No one cared enough to help us out to get through quicker.  Where was Eurostar customer service to get their passengers through and on their train?  Completely unacceptable service!!!!  If our return tickets weren’t already booked on Eurostar we would fly back to Amsterdam.    Eurostar never again!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-12-28T19:58:51Z	more than disappointing	...not that customer reviews make any difference ! My December experience featured an overcrowded VIP and standard customers lounge with a small range of unappealing shops. The Premier Business compartment, as usual, was crowded, has a poor range of papers (mainly French) and an unchanged breakfast menu. Staff seems to be thinking they are doing customers a favour. Funnily enough the prices remain unreasonably high ???	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-12-28T19:58:51Z	An absolute disgrace	"An absolute disgrace! My bicycle was lost/stolen from their train in the middle of a two month cycling tour. My trip had to be abandoned. My trip was ruined and they had the audacity to offer me a 35 Euro e-ticket as a ""gesture of goodwill"" but then took it away when I insisted they paid my train ticket back, they withdrew the insulting 35 Euro offer.The person dealing with my complaint didn't even take the time to read it properly, emailing with assumptions unrelated to my complaint.I can only assume she is neither experienced nor qualified to deal with complaints of such gravity.And L______ if you're reading this, it's probably best not to forward a complainant and email which has already been sent to you from your Legal Dept explaining to you that Eurostar are liable!I will now be suing Eurostar for full damages.See you in court and over social media.I gave you the opportunity to do the right thing and you FAILED!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Lady at the desk explained that exchanging our existing tickets would be even more expensive!So, how does this work, Eurostar charge for 2 new seats, yet nothing back on the two seats on the later service that they can now resellDisgusting rip off, I will never use Eurostar ever again!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Booked through a third party and was not informed in any emails, including those from Eurostar, about their 30 minute cut-off check in policy. Arrived with 20+ minutes to spare and no queue at check-in, but was smugly refused boarding regardless. Staff insisted that checking in 30 mins prior to departure was made clear in correspondence, but was then unable to find it in any emails to me. Was forced to pay £88 extra to board the next train.

Their rebooking fee is so steep (per person per leg so thats £120 if there's no difference in fares) and you're also unable to rebook very far ahead. All in all £200 completely wasted on unused tickets! Can't even get a voucher. I won't be travelling by Eurostar again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-12-28T19:58:51Z	Weird cancellation+change itinerary policy	"Their cancellation message says, ""If you decide not to travel, no need to let us know.""And to change journey, I'll have to pay even more than the regular fare!!!!The hell with Eurostar.

2018-12-28T19:58:51Z	I contacted Eurostar regarding travelling during the Riots	I contacted Eurostar to ask to change my tickets for a different date without the £30 per ticket penalty due to the riots in Paris. My hotel have cancelled my booking and refunded all of my money as they informed me it was unsafe to be there given that it is close to the Arc De Triomphe. Eurostar showed no compassion, no nothing, zero duty of care to their passengers. They offered no solution, no refund, no exchange without having to pay the penalty. I will not risk mine and my partners life by travelling to Paris particularly when the FCO have advised against it. The first person I spoke to didn't even know about the Riots in Paris or the recent fatalities from them. Appalling customer service. Ruined my weekend, ruined my evening. Had me in tears. Worst Riots in 50 years and Eurostar couldn't give a damn about their customers safety or their fears. All their interested in is pocketing your money and charging more for ticket exchanges.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2018-12-28T19:58:51Z	Rip off: Eurostar profits on delivering poor service to clients	We came 40 minutes before the train departure and were faced with the longest queue for only two check-in gates. When we finally managed to get to the gates 30 minutes before train's departure, the tickets became invalid and we were told by staff that we came too late, and they urged us and many others to buy new tickets for the next train if we wanted to get to London from Paris that night!At no point did Eurostar advertise that the gates close 30 minutes before train's departure.When asked Customer Service for a refund for extra tickets we had to buy even though we came on time, they said we were too late and that no refunds will be given and that it is our responsibility to anticipate queues.Essentially, Eurostar poorly manages their queues resulting in delayed check in for their customers. And by locking their gates 30 minutes before train departure (even though it takes 5min to go through security & walk to the train from check-in), they make customers miss their train and get them to buy another pair of tickets, even though they have spare seats on the next train and it is a result of their poor queue management that customers lose their train.Scam & total lack of respect and care for the customer.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-12-28T19:58:51Z	Train/hotel package rip-off	I haven't  booked a Eurostar train/hotel package for a while and won't be doing so again after the experience of the last 24 hours.  In short, I thought that I'd booked a package to Lille last night only to be instructed by a Eurostar standard message to phone the service centre to confirm.  The service centre knew nothing and advised me to clear my cookies and try again.  I discovered that the price had been hiked by nearly £100 but went ahead anyhow only to receive the same message and the same advice from the service centre who also told me that there wasn't necessarily any price advantage to booking a package.  So I booked the hotel with those nice people at Hotels.com for something closer to the original Eurostar price!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-12-28T19:58:51Z	All was fine	All was fine! The only concern was the double passport check and scans.

2018-12-28T19:58:51Z	First and last time	First and last time, i rather fly Ryanair.For that price one expects modern trains, not 25 years old ones which show every single day of usage. No wifi, no possibility to charge anything, dirty toilets. An Italian commuters train is far better, i wouldn't ever thought.So back to airplanes, don't care if i waste a hour time each way.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-12-28T19:58:51Z	Eurostar: Rubbish onboard wifi service	The Eurostar onboard wifi service is complete rubbish and should not even exist. It hardly ever functions and when it does, the connection is worse than a dial up modem. Eurostar customer services claims that it is because of the high speeds that it does not function at high speeds - explain to us then why aeroplane wifi functions at far faster speeds and why the German ICE train onboard wifi functions at high speeds.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2018-12-28T19:58:51Z	Falsely Advertised Level of Service	Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing tickets.   My husband and I thought it would be nice to take the train from Edinburgh to Paris.  I purchased tickets online and selected Premier Standard.  Little did we know that that level of service is only available on the Eurostar and that the tickets from Edinburgh to London were in standard class.  I called Eurostar customer complaints department and was told that I shouldn't have booked online and I should have known that the travel between Edinburgh and London was in second class.  The reaction of the rep - and subsequent manager - was unbelievable.  I was blamed firstly for booking the tickets online (apparently I should have called them instead ?!) and secondly for not knowing that there are different levels of service.   They were of no help, rude and condescending in their attitude.   I agree with other comments, do not take the train, fly.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2018-12-28T19:58:51Z	I booked a ticket from London to the…	"I booked a ticket from London to the Netherlands and I was forced to stay overnight in Brussels out of the blue. The representatives in the train informed me that my ticket for the NL is valid for 24hrs and that the people at the desk would help me the moment I stepped out of the train. To my surprse they probably forgot to tell me that the office was closed and I would have to wait for the next morning (hours after the connecting trains would have operated again).When contacted the company online they mentioned that ""You have an Any Dutch station and as such, you are entitled to take any service (except the Thalys) from Brussels to Amsterdam, or other Dutch cities. As such, the only time we can show on your ticket is the departure time from London and the arrival time in Brussels. Your ticket is valid for 24 hours and on this booking we don't guarantee that you will have have a direct connection from Brussels to Amsterdam. The booking shows that it is not a Direct train from London to The Netherlands. We are sorry to read that you were stranded in Brussels but we are not in the position to offer you any compensation for this, as we have offered you the service which was agreed when you have bought your ticket."" Firstly, I personally never mentioned a compensation.Secondly, I went through the website in much detail and there is no mention of 24hrs ticket validity, a non guarantee that one will not arrive ones destination on the same date booked, and yes it does say direct.  On top of that, when you choose LON- Amsterdam it clearly states which trains are directs and which not, and there are no given options after 17:00. Whereas, when you choose LON-Any Station in The Netherlands two more option pop up (late trains that do not connect) and they say that they re all direct. HOW DIFFICUTLT IS TO WRITE OVERNIGHT STAY?

They run out of meal options, magazines, the bathrooms are most of the time disgusting (or OOO without signage, so you end up waiting forever for nothing). Considering the price we pay, there really is some improvement to be made.They advertise 1 point per £1 spent but that isn't correct. If you end up not travelling, and your ticket is non-refundable, you get 0 point per £1 spent.If the train arrives more than an hour late, you don't always get compensation.

2018-10-25T09:10:57Z	If I could give 0 stars for customer…	If I could give 0 stars for customer service I would.  I recently booked a return trip London to Bruges for my Boyfriends 40th birthday, when I went on the website it gives you the option to select your destination as Bruges...one would normally expect that the destination you have selected would relate to the arrival and departure times.  I then spoke to a friend who then told me that this is just to Brussels and you have to get another train.  I then went back and looked at the small print and sure enough it does say but I think it is a bit of a marketing trick and false advertising to give you the option to select bruges on their website as your final destination if they do not actually take you there.  I called up and politely asked to change my return ticket as with what I now knew it was going to mean leaving far earlier then i had expected.  They said they  would still need to charge me change fees, I said I understood I would need to pay the difference in fair but as it allowed me to select Bruges as my final destination I feel that this is something they need to look at to avoid people making the same mistake again.  Anyway, they were completely unreasonable and showed no kind of compromise or understanding and actually just insinuated that I was stupid.  Yes it explains it all in the small print but in this day and age when booking a train / flight by a 'reputable' company you would expect the time on the ticket to correspond with the destination city that you selected on the booking platform.  Rude and unhelpful staff, I wish I had self driven and gone on the shuttle instead.  I will avoid them in the future	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-10-25T09:10:57Z	Never use, even if your life depended on it!! Take a boat, plane, cycle, drive, swim!!	"I have travelled a lot and generally put bad experiences to isolated incidents, but Eurostar just can't seem to stop giving bad experiences. From their shockingly bad service (with the exception of a few), this is probably the worst form of travel I have ever had. During the hottest summer this year, on one trip I was refused ice for my drink and the reason ""No sir, we need to keep that for those who order alcohol"". Another incident there was a 3hr delay, in the same summer, with no explanation other than ""Sir, it's delayed, what do you want me to do?"". During this 3hr delay, no refreshments, nowhere to sit, because you were not allowed in the waiting area and to top it off, I was provided with a £20 refund on the ticket. UK you would be entitled to the full amount.  Most recently, I had an issue with booking a return ticket. Arriving in Paris at 9:20am with the return on the same day at 10am. In other words I people travel 2hrs 30mins from London on a train for a visit to Paris for to wait for 30mins and head back. Regardless of whether this was human or computer error, you would think common sense would prevail.....not with this idiotic company. ""Buy a new ticket it's full price last minute £240"". What is worse, you don't get any response from their customer service, try email, tweet, phone (if you can find one), mail (if you can find one), pigeon, smoke signals. It seems that Eurostar doesn't need to adhere to any laws and are run by morons which are approved by even bigger morons. So much for EU law, I've almost converted to being glad to be leaving the EU!!STAY AWAY. FLYING ACTUALLY TAKES ABOUT THE SAME TIME AND IT'S SOOOOO MUCH CHEAPER.

2018-10-25T09:10:57Z	Find an alternative	"Get this! - I was in Paris today for meetings. I had booked my return journey on the 15.13 to London. Having finished my meetings I went to Gare du Nord and arrived at approx. 14.48 - 25 minutes before departure. At the gate my ticket did not work, I informed the attendant who informed me that the ticket gates close 30 minutes prior to departure and therefore I had missed the train. The departure gates were not busy and when I asked for discretion, I was refused and informed to buy a new ticket. I then went to the ticket office, showed my tickets and informed the Eurostar staff of the situation. The salesperson told me I had to buy a new ticket for 49Euro to get the next train. Frustrated, I explained that my work had paid GBP 109 for the 15.13 ticket and I saw no reason for the extra payment - at this, the salesperson said they would rip up my original ticket, which would mean a price of 250EURO to purchase a standalone ticket. I found this approach appalling - ""buy it or else"" - , and reticently bought a ticket for the 16.13 for 49 EURO. I then went through passport control and security, and walked to the departure lounge. As I walked past two Eurostar staff they called after me, when I turned they presumed I was there for the 15.13 and said I should go to the platform quickly as the last call had been issued. I then went to the platform, and boarded the 15.13, THE TRAIN I HAD ORIGINALLY BOOKED A TICKET FOR. I had time to walk down the platform and take the seat of my original booking. To cut a long story short, I followed up on this, expecting an apology or refund, and Eurostar staff were aggressive and threatening throughout. It should be noted that at every step they disempower their customers. In this instance, I believe Eurostar have found a dishonest way to make extra revenue and the consumer has no choice of alternative service provider - you make your case, but they just don't care as they have no competing service on the line."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Then we suffered the appalling debacle with security at Lille on the way back, terrible queues, nowhere to sit and really uneven floors making it difficult with heavy suitcases,  especially with a cracked clavicle, all adding so much time onto the journey, why can’t they do that where you board the train?

Awful experience and Company who don't care less about their custoners. We were delayed for 57 minutes to Paris with no compensation.  Rude refreshment bar staff who argued about giving me another teabag because I had to get two small cups because Eurostar had run out of large cups; and there was no toilet paper in two of the toilets that I tried. Very poor service fir an overpriced return journey (£200) Avoid!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2018-10-25T09:10:57Z	I'll never use EuroStar again. I'd rather walk!!	The most appalling customer service I've ever experienced in my life. I'll never travel with EuroStar again. I'd rather walk!!A few weeks ago I suffered a *SIX AND A HALF HOUR DELAY* with EuroStar. Arriving into London at ***03:30am***. The conditions were awful. It was hot and uncomfortable.Customer service at the time was shocking. I only saw the Train Manager once during his single walk through the carriages, and he could barely take the time to speak to me. What did we get during the ordeal? A *CUP* of water (not even a bottle) if we walked to the cafe cart ourselves, and a fun-size twix each!That was shocking enough, but the customer service afterwards was even more appalling. So there's a sliding scale for compensation in this type of case right? Between an hour and two+ delay. But when something goes catastrophically wrong do you think the company should maybe take that into consideration? A six and a half hour delay is exceptional and something deserving of a special handling. EuroStar don't seem to think so.I had to contact EuroStar multiple times to get my claim paid out as well. They only paid the percentage of the tickets originally, even though they had promised to refund our taxis.The biggest insult...get this... Whilst I put my Mum into a taxi, I took the night tube home. The train manager even suggested we do this. I thought I'd be considerate and do it, since I could get home that way. It felt like travelling home with zoo animals, it was horrendous. So, I don't get indoors til gone 5am right. EuroStar refuse to pay my *****£2.80***** tube fare!!Compassion?Customer Service?Alien terms to these corporate jobsworthsThis is an exceptional circumstance, I get that. For that exact reason alone EuroStar should be grovelling, saying 'usually we're really good, here, let me do anything to prove to you that when things go catastrophically wrong you can count on us. Please ride with us again'.This type of handling would be a stroke of genius, promoting word of mouth recommendations of admiration that whilst it was an ordeal, they make sure you're sorted if something really off the scale from a normal delay happens.Instead, they're quoting rules of carriage to me and making me waste my time, and producing the most annoyed and frustrated customer ever.I literally tell anyone and everyone about how crap the trip was, how bad the service has been, and go into every single detail and communication I've had; there's not been a single person not shocked and appalled. I don't think I'm the only person that'll be put off ever using EuroStar after hearing my story.For a company that spends millions of pounds on advertising, they can't even spare £2.80 of good-will for someone that's been so put out.You couldn't pay me to go on EuroStar again. They don't deserve my money!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

When I asked them how to avoid this situation in future, the sales staff sneered 'buy business class'.Basically this is a service for business travelers only, and they'll treat you like scum if you aren't one.

All our travel plans were disrupted, we'd wasted money on a hotel for the previous night in Ashford, and by the time we got to Paris we were frustrated and exhausted. And Eurostar are refusing to take responsibility or even consider any level of compensation or gesture of goodwill. Shocking customer service. Never again.

After claiming online, I received confirmation the compensation would take up to 28 days to reach my bank account.28 days later, nothing. Contacted customer service and was told: ""Further to my previous email I have been informed that the claim for your ticket failed as a bank transfer due to a fault with our own systems, this has now been amended and re-submitted but this could take up to another 28 days to be received.""28 days later, same issue and same answer. My trip was on the 1st of June and I am now hoping to receive the payment by mid-September.It's ridiculous for a company such as Eurostar to not be able to process payments in a timely manner. They clearly have no problems taking your money when buying a ticket on their website so my thought on this is that they are hoping people will give up on their compensation before it is paid.I have now reached out to the Mediateur Sncf and submitted a request for help. I am sure I am not the only one in this situation so I hope a big action can be taken collectively to finally get what is owed to users of this service."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-08-30T15:35:34Z	What a shambles!! SHAME ON THEM	What a shambles!!!!!Booked to go to brussels, from Ashford INTERNATIONAL Station, told  36hrs before departure that the trains cannot stop at Ashford till September!!! After no joy whatsoever with eurostar, we had to: cxl hotel in AshfordDrive to Ebsfleet for 5am ( pay £40  parking)Sort the mess out ourselfs (as staff were a bit confused as to what to do for return)Not so much as a complimentry breakfast offered!!!BTW Train was disgusting got flea bites on legs!!Return trip even more farsical, they boarded us onto a train that went direct to St Pancreas without even telling us (all we heard was no Ashford) so assumed their system knew we were going to Ebsfleet!!Then to top the lot we wasnt allowed to board a train as eurostar hadnt stamped the ticket to allow us to travel from St pancras to ebsfleet.... We was made to feel like train jumpers.The whole holiday was ruined by the INCOMPETENCE of Eurostar & South Eastern with their INCAPACITY to provide some sort of service...How the customer service staff sleep at night, should sadden them...Only one thing left to say....SHAME ON THEM!!!

2018-08-30T15:35:34Z	Zero customer flexibility or…	Zero customer flexibility or understanding.I have used Eurostar over a 100 times. Lately, the trains have been late several times and there are all kinds of issues with queues and boarding delays.But, given the convenience of the central stations, I have never previously considered alternative transport. I am seriously doing that now.Given all the queuing issues and delays, I have never once seen the 30 minute rule regarding boarding cut off being enforced. A few days ago, we were only 2 minutes late and that really was due to bad luck: sick girlfriend (I carried her bags), metro delays and, last but not least, the  usual escalator/staircase that gave access to the gate had completely changed location to the opposite end of Paris Gare du Nord.The female staff member at the gate was very rude. She agreed our Monday evening train was relatively empty. Visibly, 2-3 people were still going through security so that all she had to do was allow us in. She agreed that she could but that rules were rules. To my point  that rules could be augmented by a bit of human flexibility, she retorted that I should stop arguing  or she'd make me pay in excess  of 200 euros per person for a brand new ticket instead of the additional fee.  She stated that 30 minutes or less before the departure, seats were reallocated or re-sold. This may be true but that makes no sense. Does that mean then that a person buying a last minute ticket is exempt from the 30 minute rule? I even suggested that in that case I pay the admin fee to get on our original train but she'd stopped listening at that point.We were desperate to get back asap and Eurostar was completely uncaring. I don't really care about the money as I am fortunate on that level but this is about humanity and treating your customers with respect.Attempts post-journey to make Eurostar Customer Service show some humanity have also proved futile.All in all, a very sour taste in the mouth and zero desire to ever use again. It's so bad that, despite the airplane hassle, I'd rather fly.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-08-30T15:35:34Z	Awful Eurostar, find another way to travel.	"Apologies for the lengthy review but it is important I tell you everything.  In July this year, never having travelled with Eurostar before and having read the ticket options, we were sold on the upgrade options of their Business Premier class ticket travelling from Brussels to London Saint Pancras.  (Trustpilot won't allow the abbreviation for Saint, it thinks it's a rude word) We were really looking forward to experiencing what was advertised as a great experience and to begin with, the Business Lounge at Brussels seemed to indicate we were in for a treat, however, aside from being greeted at the lounge entrance, we were then left to find a seat/table and had to work out what was on offer.  It would have been nice if someone had shown us around and explained what was available to us.We grabbed a coffee and pastry and not long after an announcement told us to board the train.  When leaving the lounge, we were swept up in large crowd all rushing to find a seat, it was difficult to work out which way we had to go to find our carriage.  Eventually we spotted a sign and were swept along by the massing crowd.  When we arrive on the platform, it was very difficult to see the carriage numbers, hidden behind the carriage windows on a small, unlit, digital numbered screen.  Not to worry we found it.When boarding the train, we found the steps difficult to navigate with one large heavy suitcase and two smaller ones.  Despite struggling, there was no help was offered by train staff and other passengers blocking the doorway, whilst looking at which newspaper/magazine they wanted to read, didn't help.When we found our seats, we were horrified to find that leg room was less than on a RYANAIR plane, so we asked to be moved and were given, not shown, other seats with a table in between.  The carriage was not full and these seats were empty, so why did they try to squash us into such small seats in the first place?Unfortunately, we found one of the four seats by the window was broken, which may explain why they didn't give us those seats in the first place but there was only two of us, so the broken seat didn't come into the equation?Anyway, our first impression of the train carriage was that it looked old, worn out, the paintwork was in a bad state, scratched and flaking, the carpet was old and heavily stained.  The seat cushions and general condition of the upholstery was poor, definitely NOT what we were expecting in Business Premier class.  When asking a staff member about accessing the Wifi, we were told, ""Oh! we don't have it on this train as it is a Vintage train"".  It wasn't vintage it was old and decrepit.Still we were looking forward to the Raymond Blanc designed meal, advertised in their ticket options for Business Premier.  First came a bread roll, small croissant and butter, with tea, or coffee, a yoghurt an a small bottle of OJ & water.  OK to start the journey with, the breakfast was welcome but nothing out of the ordinary.  Sometime later they collected our trays and brought out lunch, yippee!  We were offered either, a cold chicken dish with salad, or a hot dish.  We both chose the hot dish, wanting to see what culinary delight lay in store for us, designed by Raymond Blanc. Excited!What we were given was.... A very neat rectangle of scrambled egg, two weeny rashers of overcooked (tough, not crisp) bacon, three cherry tomatoes and some sliced mushrooms in a very tarte vinegar sauce.  That was it.Hardly a meal worthy of claims to have been designed by Raymond Blanc.  A 5 year old could have ""designed"" it.  I commented that scrambled eggs and bacon was a dish that dates back centuries, way before Raymond Blanc ever thought of ""designing"" it.  Absolutely awful, a real let down.The whole experience was hugely disappointing and at a whopping price of £288 per person, one way, it left a really bad taste in the mouth, much like the Raymond Blanc ""designed"" meal.When we got home, I decided to tell Eurostar about our poor experience, letting them know that it was well below our expectations of Business Premier class, including all of the comments detailed above.  I wasn't sure what to expect in response but what I got was wholly unacceptable, dismissive and cynical reply.  It appeared the responder had not read my letter thoroughly, or it was just a standard letter.I wrote back, saying I was unhappy with their reply and i received another letter simply repeating the first letter writer's excuses, ending by saying I trust you enjoyed your trip and look forward to you welcoming you on board Eurostar again in the future???  This was supposed to be from their Customer Services department, more like the Sales Preventatives department.Another letter from me, resulted in this last reply.  ""The meals in Business Premier are designed by Ramond (sic) Blanc. I am sorry that the meal was not to your taste and this has been fed back  (Was that an unintended pun) to the catering team for you.We currently have 4 of our original trains left in service, so we use our newer trains on our website as you are much more likely to travel on either a refurbished or new train. The remainder of the original trains should be removed from service by the end of the year. Wi fi is not available on our original trains, we do mention this in our conditions of carriage that if wi fi is not available then we are regrettably not able to offer compensation for this. The service we offer onboard, the business lounge access and also the flexibility that we offer within the cost of a Business Premier ticket all remain the same regardless of the type of train you travel on. I hope that this explains everything for you and I hope that we can welcome you back onboard in the future.""Not bloody likely!!!  By the way, Wifi is in paragraph 56 of their terms & conditions, near the very end.  Has anyone read the terms & conditions before booking a ticket? I doubt it very much, we were only buying a blooming train ticket!The only one thing I can say good about the journey is, it arrived on time. Nothing else good about it.Directors of Eurostar, wake up and smell the coffee, no wait, taste the food, it's *hit.  You have lost another two passengers, not even a hint of a sincere apology, no acceptance of the points raised just lame excuses.  They couldn't wait to tell us that they would not be offering us any compensation, funny that, we didn't ask for any.  However, it would have been nice to perhaps offer a discount off a future journey but no, our comments about our experience were dismissed out of hand.Eurostar, NEVER AGAIN and I really hope this very lengthy review of the disgusting way you treat your passengers is read by many before they think of paying for a Business Premier ticket, it is NOT worth it."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-08-30T15:35:34Z	Rubbish Travel Experience	My wife and I booked a return trip from Ashford to Paris approx. six months in advance. A couple of days before we were due to leave, we were informed by text that on the return journey the train wouldn't stop at Ashford, but at Ebbsfleet and then we'd catch a SE train back to Ashford. However, when we arrived at Ashford for the outward journey, we were told that the Ebbsfleet diversion was necessary, too. Having boarded the train at Ebbsfleet, we continued back to Ashford, but apparently, someone was threatening to commit suicide by jumping onto the track. This resulted in a total delay of 70 minutes. Although this was not Eurostar's fault, we were given EUR 12.50 compensation for each ticket. However, this was not cash, but will be deducted from any future Eurostar tickets, IF WE EVER USE THEM AGAIN!! On both outward and return journeys, our reserved seats were changed (we were still on the same trains as booked, so there was no excuse for this). Why reserve seats if they are not honoured?  After this poor experience, I will think long and hard before taking a risk with them again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2018-08-30T15:35:34Z	Eurostar sucks	Eurostar sucks. Minor/petty issues I am sure, but recent trip using Eurostar, as follows:1) St Pancras not fit for purpose. Way overcrowded, people everywhere.2) Train on way out delayed by 40 mins, not a believable reason given.3) My partner could not use her tickets out and back due to having an accident, no ability to cancel, only exchange, at ridiculous costs.4) Had to come back early, exchanged 3 of my 4 tickets (partners was not used/exchanged), cost of gbp 350, more than the tickets cost. Moved from 4pm Sunday to 10am Sunday.5) On way back from Paris, queues getting through security, tickets, passport control x2; so badly managed. We got straight through, however loads of people didn’t and missed their train due to this.6) Train therefore delayed by 40 minutes approx.7) Most of the toilets were not working, or were in a state whereby you would rather not use them.8. This one made me laugh, held up before getting in to Ebbsfleet, why? Someone forgot to redirect the tracks into Ebbsfleet. Haha, one job!!So, was happy to leave it at that, then find out they charged me the gbp350 exchange TWICE.9) Sent an email explaining this, and outlining some of the above points. They couldn’t care less really. Told me I needed to contact the website or agent directly that I booked with. I changed my booking on Eurostar website, and was emailing Eurostar contact form, via their website. 10) Explained this to them. Never heard back. Sent them another email asking for them to respond to me. Nothing, they don’t care!So, Eurostar suck. HSBC don’t, they refunded me the money immediately and will take this up on my behalf.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

I was told to go back home and come the following day i asked to speak to a manager because my son will not understand that we got to the station and we will not take the trains no way !he will at through himself kick scream and cry so loudly it will at be a big nightmare for me and the other travellers .the manager came and she was a lovely blonde woman that exchanged my ticket for free and help us with our lugages  we where able to catch the 10:58 trains for brussels where we are actually enjoying our holidayfor me it was a huge relief  from the button of my heart would like to say THANK you to that angel.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5

I am aware that you cannot change a name on the booking (which i think is ridiculous as the administration time to change over a name is <1minute)I have asked if i can cancel that booking off so i can book a new person on (and pay again) as the train coming back to London is no longer available, so need to use the 'available' space. I have been told that this is not your policy which i think is completely ridiculous AND not environmentally friendly as your not giving available space on the train when you know that this person isn't going to travel.

2018-08-30T15:35:34Z	No compensation, even on insurance	My return train from Paris on the eve of Th 5th July was cancelled at the last moment (without explanation), along with others that day.  We were told that, being the weekend, there would be no more seats available until Monday at the very earliest & even then they would not be able to accomodate everyone.  I found a hotel for the night & got an EasyJet flight back the next day.  Now my insurance company won't refund me for the expense without confirmation from Eurostar that the delay was more than 24hrs. Eurostar refuse to confirm this, saying they run plenty of trains, so I might have got home within 24hrs, notwithstanding what we were told in Paris.  But irrespective of what we were told in Paris & no matter how long I'd waited in Paris for a train, if I'd incurred any expenses for a hotel etc there would be no way of proving that I had got on the first train available & therefore would still not be able to claim anything on insurance.  Thanks to them I am now more than £300 out of pocket.  They don't even deserve one star, but there was no option to give less.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-08-30T15:35:34Z	Pathetic staff. Just 3 minutes late and refused entry.	We arrived 3 minutes after the gates were close, but still 27 minutes before the train departure. Then I approached one of the staff and she simply and without any flexibility refused to let us go through the gate. I argued with her for a couple of minutes until one of her colleague arrived and asked the problem. She told her that we were 5 minutes late and that's the reason she didn't let us go through( of course, by that time we were 5 minutes late because I was arguing with her for 2 minutes. If I have argued with her for 15 minutes then she surely would have claimed we were 18 minutes late). Noticing her attitude and approach I realized that she is one the most unhelpful person that regardless of 1 minute late or 3 or 5 minutes she wouldn't let us entry. (Based on her personal reaction and attitude I kind of felt that probably she would have let us go through If we were not from a small ethnic minority).Surely, we were 3 minutes late, but she could see that we were with pram and kids and she could have let us go through and nothing would have happened. She asked us to visit the ticket office to find out that we have to pay about £176 extra, wait for 2 hours and likely be allocated in different carriage(with baby and kids). I refused to accept as this was just a day visiting Paris for the kids to see the Eiffel tower and The Louvre and back to London in the evening. When leaving the station I approached her to let her know that she ruined our day. Then she told me that we were 6 minutes late. When I heard that I had nothing to say. Just shocked.Couldn't believe.An absolutely dreadful and pathetic person.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Next train to get us home could not stop in Ashford, had to go through Ashford, wave at our parked car, get to Ebbsfleet, then wait for another train to go back to Ashford. The bigger problem is then not being able to get in touch with or get replies from Eurostar to sort compensation. Automated system does not accept the ticket numbers. Telephone staff admit this is a problem and tell you email in. Email response says there will be a delay due to amount of e-mails.

2018-07-23T13:40:44Z	I strongly advise you to stay away from Eurostar	"I strongly advise you to stay away from Eurostar. This is not to do with the trains, but with their offering and horrendous customer service.Eurostar offers tickets for half the trip and all of the costs as connections may no longer be running when arriving at a transfer point. The first available connection, for me, was over 7 hours later (more than twice the total travel time). For the majority of people with a job this is going to be unacceptable.One would expect that such tickets are simply unavailable or that this, at the very least, is very clear when ordering tickets. This is far from the truth however.Your options are: waiting 7 hours, getting a hotel or driving to and from the transfer point.Compensation for this inconvenience is unlikely as this requires you to contact customer service. Customer service is rarely excellent, but Eurostar is another story alltogether.Customer service will tell you that they think it is perfectly normal to offer such an inferior product, to communicate this poorly and to leave their customers high and dry.Everyone not willing to wait for over 7 hours, is making a ""personal choice"" according to Eurostar and will have to bear the cost themselves. Another tactic of theirs is to advise you to take it up with your insurer.

2018-07-23T13:40:44Z	Some positive experiences but one really dreadful negative one!	I have had a number of positive experiences with Eurostar which is the reason i give 3 but the negative experience i had was truly awful.Eurostar work with Thalys in terms of some of the journey is on a Thalys train. The Thalys manager on July 3rd on the train to Paris was absolutely vile. He was extremely rude and even though i had a ticket he forced me to buy a new one.i have complained to Eurostar but have not received a response.i would like to say that the Eurostar staff in Brussels are very nice and helpful.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3

2018-07-23T13:40:44Z	Last minute cancellations and chaos	A simple journey to Brussels from London involved both trains being cancelled at very short notice with no explanation whatsoever. Information on getting on another train was completely lacking - both online and at the stations, resulting in chaos and confusion. Eurostar, you're on a par with Ryanair.Update: The 'compensation' offered for 2 cancelled trains and hours of delays is 12 pounds. Saying that, they still haven't paid it 2 weeks later, and are not answering emails. Dropping your rating to 1, because you are lol-level terrible.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-07-23T13:40:44Z	Goods stolen from bag during transport	I would rate my experience as 0 stars but this is not an option!!!The first issue was that the package was not delivered on time, and in fact arrived 4 days late. Through out this process i had to contact the Euro Despatch contact centre several times to find out where and what was happening to my package. Even though I left my number with them and multiple times they said they would contact me as to what would happen with my package, i received no call back. This service is unacceptable and should be looked into asap to sort it out. On to the second issue, while in transit the bag has been opened and several items have been stolen including a laptop and digital camera. On top of this i have found a few items deliberately damaged, such as a pair of running shoes which have had the shoe laces cut. Who does that??? It makes me sick thinking what might have happened to the bag and contents while it was in transit.  I don't know how this could happen as they say they keep the bags in a secure area. After contacting Eurostar about the stolen goods they said they would reply within 14 days. 2 and a half months later and multiple emails and phone calls to try get an answer on my case they finally replied taking no responsibility for the stolen goods during transport and no refund of my service fee after the bag arrived 4 days late. I can not express how useless the Eurostar team are and how much they don't care about you or your personal items!!The experience using Euro Despatch has been very disappointing, I hope someone else can see this review and avoid them in the future. Never transport oversized goods or bicycles with Eurostar!!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-07-23T13:40:44Z	Eurostar took 3 payments out for the same ticket, charging £530 extra!	A £265 journey was charged 3 times on my credit card by their web-site. They only sent me 1x ticket by email, so I only realised they'd over-charged once I checked my credit card statement. It then took me 30 minutes to get this sorted with their call-centre to get £530 refunded onto my credit card. They then tell me it can take 28 days to get this back. Call center staff unhelpful, initially didn't even apologise, then refused to offer any goodwill gesture even though they tried to rip me off £530. Poor service overall.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-07-23T13:40:44Z	Oh I wish I had read Trustpilot before booking	This is not so much a train company as an expensive and uncomfortable way to travel.My homeward train from Paris to London was cancelled late the evening before departure. By this time all Eurostar staff had gone home and their website wasn't working so I could not re-book nor find out what their compensation policy was.I had to find a hotel for the evening and re-book myself  - all this wasted a day of my holiday.Arriving at Gare Du Nord for my rescheduled train at 06:00 (the train was the 07:15 train) - it was chaos. No signs as to where to check in - but by asking a security officer we found it is located on a small balcony upstairs. This was packed - people were still checking in for the 06:45 train at 0645!the first passport control had two people on it - one working and one watching him work. The second passport control (why two ???) was little better but at least here the e-passport machines were sometimes working. Then more queues for security and more queues to get onto the platform. The train left 45 mins late (and arrived in London 45 mins late) - all due to the inept check-in in Paris.If I never travel by Eurostar again it will be too soon.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

So far the claim process seems extraordinarily inept, incompetent and slow. Acknowledgements of claims are not made, their system does not function with all browsers and one gets the impression the aim is to ensure one becomes too  demoralised to keep on trying.

You are pushed around in line by people who love moving the elastic band that keeps you tied in only to cause more confusion and stress. They are clueless at who to send where all the time you are lugging children and bags. There were 4 trains and my suggestion to those who should know better.1. form 1 line for each train so people aren't wondering2. feed the lines through check in on based on next train leaving3. have a queue for families it works in most sensible airports so why not there. you will have less frazzled parents and annoying kids (mine being one of them)4. put people in charge who understand customer service and queue management5. we were cramped on board only to find people sat where they pleased even though we weren't able to book a table seat6. they serve wine and beer if you're desperate7. unless the weather bad....fly8. the carpets are dirty so I avoided the toilets but bring we wipes to clean your drop down table9. there is no internet irrespective if what you've read	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

When i went online to book i was shocked to find out how much they are charging their customers.   i feel that they have been given a licence to print money and they are taking full advantage.  I was going to  travel with my  family of four.  The price was coming to £800 just for the weekend . How can they be allowed to get away with charging such an extortionate fare for a train journey that is no more than London to Manchester.

There were others in a similar position apparently its ok for eurostar to take money from people and not provide the seat !! Staff unhelpful basically didnt care at all. Return journey train didnt stop at Ashford ""new trains"" unsuitable for the platform so passengers sent to Ebbsfleet then herded back via normal train again unhelpful rude staff.

Not helpful as we needed to cycle out of London. Had to take a taxi (£60) as we cannot get four on three bikes. Promised bikes would be sent home to Bristol.

Terrible waiting lines in the French passport control. Machines for biometric passport rebooting. Awful staff and absolutely no sense of responsibility from the company.

This cuts both ways. I shall now use them as a last resort and make others aware of their poor standards:Dear Richard Thank you for your email. I'm sorry that your Eurostar journey was disrupted.In regards to your Taxi charges and refunding the charge you faced there, unfortunately this is classed as a consequential loss. To claim expenses for these costs, you'll need to get in touch with your travel insurance provider. If you need anything from us to support your claim, please let me know. We'll be happy to provide you with the information you might need about the disrupted journey.I can see you were delayed by (92) minutes. You are therefore entitled to either:An e-voucher to the value of (£14), which you can claim Here.A partial refund to the value of (£14), which you can claim Here.The way this is worked is based on our compensation policy. Any part of your journey that is delayed by 60-119 minutes, you are entitled to compensation valued at 25% of the price of the affected leg. To find out more about compensation, take a look at our Help Centre.I hope this helps but if there's anything else I can do, please get in touch.Kind regards,MohammedEurostar Customer Care	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2018-06-05T22:02:57Z	Worst customer experience	My family and I were traveling to Paris from London on a vacation with small kids. We already had the tickets and as we tried to go through the check-in process they told us we were a few minutes late so we needed to find a a new time.  As we went to try and change our tickets they told us there were no available tickets for another 3 to 4 days.  I requested to talk to a manager to see if they could make some accommodations for us but he was so rude and didn’t even care.  I told him we were from the States and he said “well that’s too bad it doesn’t work like that here.”  He also told us that there was a waitlist that we could get on.  After standing in line again the ticket agent said no such thing exist.I was in shock in how the supervisor behaved needless to say and the inconsistency of information.It’s very disappointing that these individuals ruined our vacation and that Eurostar has a monopoly on the Paris route.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

The staff provided a beverage service to everyone else in our car. As it turns out we are the only two Black people in the Car 8.I am so not happy.UPDATE:The train manager said it was a genuine error. It was a new member of staff on her fifth day on the job and she had missed many others before us.This of course raises numerous other questions. Do you hire inexperienced staff to work in your Premier cabins where clients are paying the highest fares? Also the service was jointly done by two members of staff ... so why blame the most junior?Anyway, they apologised and flooded the cabinet with other staff members were were of different ethnic orientations.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-06-05T22:02:57Z	Terrible Service	Good afternoon,Being a french person living in England I am a regular user of the Eurostar, I think its a wonderful service and I am so happy that it has been there for me in moments where I needed to rush home, or just spend a lovely weekend in either London, Paris, Lille, etc etc.I am used to the Eurostar’s service being impeccable, on time, and comfortable.But this weekend this did not happen.I got the train from St Pancras to Brugges on friday evening. The service ran with 70 min delay.Now, I do understand that signal failure is not the Eurostar’s fault, but this did mean that I got to my destination at around midnight, and that over an hour late, I do believe you offer compensation?My biggest problem was the return, my Eurostar ticket was from “any beligian station”, so I had to change to get the Eurostar from there. One of the trains from my previous station stopped on the track which meant that I couldn’t meet the 30 minute in advance, after running, I only manage to get to the Eurostar desk 20 minute in advance, with my train still up on the board.The staff at the brussels Eurostar desk really weren’t very friendly at all and they didn’t let me get through. Saying it was “ shut “ event though the train hadn’t yet departed.I say that I could run, as it was the last one of the night, really needing to get home I really wanted to get on it. But they snapped at me saying I can’t expect the train nor the boarder police to “just wait for me “.They said I was too late and didn’t show any compassion.I only had a small hand bag, my passport at the ready, I could have ran . it makes me so upset that this means I had to get a hotel overnight or get a night bus .I only ask that Eurostar could have shown a little bit of compassion. I am so disappointed with a service that I always have seen as luxury that has let me down twice over the weekend.Having spent 110 pounds on my ticket I am really upset and especially feel that it was fair. I really love Eurostar and I am sad that my opinion is now tainted, now please tell me, is it normal for Eurostar to act this way? Or is this just unfortunate on my side?Thank you Marilia	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2018-06-05T22:02:57Z	getting better!	We were due to go to Disneyland Paris via Lille on Monday 14th May. At the time of booking we did not know about the train strikes in France. The day before we where due to leave I got a email from the French train network. Most of it was in French, understandably, so I didn't understand it but I managed to work out that it said that our connecting train in Lille had been cancelled. I phoned Eurostar, who had made no attempt to tell me this, who said it had not been cancelled. I checked the French train network website which reported that it had been cancelled. I phoned back again and this time they admitted they had made a mistake and the connection had been cancelled. If I had not checked myself then I could have been stranded in Lille with my 2 year old son on the word of a Eurostar customer services call handler. Appalled! Will never use Eurostar again!UPDATE:I contacted Eurostar who initially told me I had not booked through them in the first place which made me both angry and bemused. How on earth do they not know if I'd booked with them or not! When I eventually convinced them that I had booked with them they stated it wasn't there problem as it was the French Network who's train it was. All this despite the fact I'd booked through them. They said the call centre employee didn't have the information at the time but did have it five minutes later when I phoned back. I feel lied too! I emplore you please don't use Eurostar! I will never travel with them again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3
2018-06-05T22:02:57Z	Disneyland on Eurostar	Normally Eurostar is OK, I use them about 10 times per year and things generally work (even at the notorious Paris terminal).  But they have really struggled with managing the impact of the SNCF strikes in April.  I have had three sets of reservations cancelled because of this, but couldn't change them on line (other than for extortionate prices, even though the advice page claimed I could change them for free) nor get through to their call centre to change them at all over many attempts.  This meant I could not be sure of travelling on any particular train back from Dresden via Brussels to London so I went by plane instead.  You should be aware that, if you do make a booking with Eurostar, the most they will give you back in such a situation is the fare paid with no compensation.  When I did get through to the call centre (about 10 days after I got back), there was no question of a compensation ticket for another time because their 'policy when things go wrong' has been watered down.  Because I had booked sometime in advance, the fare paid was nowhere what it actually cost to get back that day (8th April).  It was a poor experience all round, even BA managed better last May during their power outage.  My advice:  don't make ANY bookings with them whilst the strikes continue, you will be left on your own if the train is cancelled!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-06-05T22:02:57Z	Normally Eurostar is OK, but don't make a booking until the SNCF strikes finish	No customer care or empathy! Exactly like previous reviews. We booked our tickets in January very excited to go. Closer to the date we asked if we could delay the trip due to a unexpected health surgery my partner had to have which meant he was not fit to travel. We did not want a refund just to move it a week or two later or atleast a gift voucher to use for another booking with the same company. They were not willing to understand or cooperate. Kept referring us to the travel insurance company which made no sense at all for us to do as the excess alone was the same cost. The hotel (hotels.com) gave us a refund understanding our situation because they hve empathy and care but eurostar are just business money orientated!Hundreds of times they have empty seats going back and forth so what difference does it make with 2 changes for this unexpected and sad circumstance(medical evidence could have been provided from the doctor) They instead told us we can pay the same price as our return trip per journey to chance it. Quite hillarious.I will never travel with eurostar again if i can help it and because of this response we decided to not go to paris/france but chose another europe destination. Shame on eurostar!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	2
2018-06-05T22:02:57Z	No customer care or empathy	There's too much of a story behind why I am leaving a bad review but in essence, during the last bout of French rail strikes, our experience of Eurostar service, and the subsequent lack of customer care afterwards, was quite frankly, appalling.Misinformation and half truths told by employees and total lack of communication at every stage. Any response from customer services was scripted and consisted of policy paragraphs being copied and pasted into emails. Not helpful whatsoever and left me feeling angry and lost.No reply from my attempt to communicate with the CEO either. No surprises there I suppose. I have for many years defended their high prices to friends and family saying the service was fantastic and made life so much easier when travelling to France. However, as a direct result of my last experience, I shall never use Eurostar again and will certainly not be advocating them to friends and family ever again.Shame on you, Eurostar.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-06-05T22:02:57Z	Zero customer care, respect or empathy.	Travelled on Friday 20th from St Pancras to Lille and was not impressed by rudeness of Security staff. I was wearing a new jacket which at the last minute I was told to remove and the staff took it and laid it carelessly on top of my luggage. It  ended up shredded  in the conveyor and covered in oil. Had it not been for my husband speaking fluent French we wouldn't have had anyone to help us. Eventually we were taken aside and it took so long to find a form we nearly missed the train.The staff were so rude as if we were about to be charged for something. Not necessary at all ! The form I was given had the wrong email address for contact and I have spent all morning trying to find the correct email. To add insult to injury we were given incorrect info regarding the strike and we had to rebook our seats to get a seat four hours later.We spent £40 on a taxi to Lille Station to get accurate info  as on line details were contradictory. Not impressed at all .In Lille's favour the staff were far more obliging ! Our on going connections from Euston were totally messed up and the day ended splendidly 12 hours later with trains still out of action on the route to Blackpool.

After failing to move the other two customers who had boarded incorrectly we were asked to move which wouldn’t have been a problem however we were expected to be split up which we weren’t prepared to do and after having to stand for the first half an hour of our journey and being spoken to rudely by staff including being sworn at it was discovered there was two seats together all along... As well as the terrible journey Euro star failed to respond in a satisfactory manor after the events not responding for two weeks after my initial complaint and then once I finally received a reply it was a very unconvincing acknowledgment of the events and that they will look into them. Since this I haven’t heard from Euro star at all and I would not recommend anyone to use this service due to their complete lack of customer service both on the train and via their complaints department.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-04-17T20:26:59Z	Loved it but a few negatives	My wife and I travelled from Paris to London on 14th April 2018. We were both impressed. The staff at Paris were extremely busy due to this being in the middle of the union strikes in Paris but were pleasant and helpful in every respect. The train itself was clean, comfortable and again the staff on board pleasant and engaging. The negatives: Paris Gare du Nord is not set up properly for Eurostar. The queuing system is a shambles but I'm sure this is due to lack of space. One or two more staff would ease the problems of group bookings just pushing through lines that have been halted due to congestion and more money needs to be invested into the customs process.(this is no fault of Eurostar ). If you are travelling standard or premium standard be prepared to queue and re queue and allow yourself plenty of time. Even with these negatives we found it a totally enjoyable experience.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4
2018-04-17T20:26:59Z	Lack of transparency and faulty website	I am sharing my experience in the hopes to prevent someone from going through the same thing. Due to a glitch on the website, I found myself with my destinations reversed. My tickets were now useless and as I was told not refundable even though I had taken an insurance. The said insurance was supposed to cover the cancellation fees but it was not advertised that economy tickets were not refundable. Thanks to Eurostar I wasted 300 pounds. So I urge anyone wanting to travel with this company (I would advise you not to but should you anyway) to check about a good hundred times where you are going and when and not to waste more of your money on a useless insurance.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2018-04-17T20:26:59Z	They still haven't learned what good service is	HelloOn March 22nd, in a context of SNCF strike and multiple Eurostar cancellations, I made a booking change by mistake which is heavily charged by the Eurostar services:My train was scheduled for March 23rd London-Paris from 07:01 (booking RTMASC). Late evening on March 22, I went on the site eurostar.com to go through train cancellations news, I unfortunately confused the cancellation of the 07:04 Paris - Londres for my 07: 01 train.Eurostar was offering to make a booking change for the canceled trains, without further wait I changed my booking- which I thought was canceled. It must be known that this trip was only a stop from my ultimate destination, going to the Caribbean for long awaited reunion with my family.In this context of initial error on my part, I was convinced that the train was canceled and that I would be moreover reimbursed 100% by Eurostar because of the strike as it was announced.- Booking change made on March 23rd at 00:34 for the London-Paris train from 05:40 £ 260 feesI received confirmation with note that the train was overbooked and did not have a guaranteed seat.Please note that only 15 minutes had passed, late at night, between the change and the ‘cancellation of the change '.This was not done for comfort or a change of mind, a large part of the trains were canceled and I thought I did what I was asked by changing the booking of a canceled train with a refund that would follow subsequently by Eurostar services. I must add that until 5am, my train did not appear on 'live departure' from where my confusion even greaterA beautiful mistake! Certainly, but what I find more worrying is again the lack of service of Eurostar. They have refused to date to cancel these fees. We are talking about £ 322, a nice sum.I appeal to your understanding and help on this case.Waiting for an answer.M.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-04-17T20:26:59Z	Terrible customer service	Terrible customer service. I understand they sometimes have to cancel trains due to matters out of their control, but the way they deal with it is unacceptable.  Replacement journeys are at non comparable times, effectively cutting a day off the time away.It is near impossible to get hold of anyone on the customer service helpline and if you get through, they all have a standard ‘ nothing we can do’ script. They lied and said a manager would call back to discuss journey options. Dreadful all round experience!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-04-17T20:26:59Z	Website bookings	"So, tried to take advantage of a 15% discount offer on an Interrail ticket which the offer was due to run out on Saturday 31st March. Obviously you need to know you can get under ""the channel"" before setting a date for your interrail ticket to start. So I tried and tried numerous times (and I really mean numerous) to book and pay for a ticket on the Saturday evening with no success as it always came up with an error message. So tried and tried again the following morning again with no success, so eventually had to give in and had to phone up to place my order for my tickets.......""yes sir we've been having problems with our website, but that'll still cost you £10 for booking over the phone!!!!!!""When I complained to customer services they said I should of kept a note of the error code, does it state that anywhere that I had to do that.I even gave the customer services guy the time of my telephone call to book the tickets so he could actually hear their employee say that they were having problems. What if the website was having problems for a week, what are you meant to do then?????SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY A BOOKING FEE IF THE WEBSITE IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY!!!!!!!!! Been trying to explain this to a customer services man who surprise surprise doesn't agree.....eventually with all these 1 star reviews I hope they receive a huge fine somewhere along the line!!!!!Plus I lost out on the 15% interrail offer. NOT HAPPY"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

To be fair the staff at ebbs fleet were OK but I will be home over 2 hours late because 1 eurostar are an hour late and 2 because they are not stopping where we were contracted to go. 50 quid also spent on a peak ticket to ebbs fleet for me and the eldest this morning.poor is being generous.

2018-04-17T20:26:59Z	Terrible service and no consideration…	Terrible service and no consideration for customers. I was due to travel over the weekend but unfortunately spent Friday in hospital and now have limited mobility meaning I couldn't travel. The advertised claim of 'change time/ date of tickets for just £30' is misleading, it actually cost me £164 to change tickets for me and my friend. Customer service were no help after I was direct to them via the online chat service (who assured me they could help) and said as it's my fault I couldn't travel not theirs it was right that I should pay. Should I have realised changing tickets would have cost as much as two new tickets I would have flown instead. Deeply regret using this company and will definitely not make the same mistake again	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-04-17T20:26:59Z	Horrible customer service, theifs in disguise.	I waited on hold for at least an hour. I booked my train and saw there was a mistake. It must of been an hour since I ordered it. I saw it was a one way and I just wanted it to be round trip. I didn’t want my money back, I was just going to change it to round trip. They told me no, that there was nothing they can do. I asked to speak to a manager and their actual response was “the manager isn’t going to waster her time telling you the same thing I did. Sorry nothing we can do” what a complete joke of customer service and I can’t believe they want to rip people off their hard earned money. Now I have to buy another ticket back to London. My London to Paris ticket was 290 US dollars and Paris to London is 186 US dollars. The round trip would of been 340 US dollars total.  They have no intent of making their customers happy. Horrible company.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2018-04-17T20:26:59Z	RUBBISH SERVICE	One star from me and that's only because I can't put none. My daughter and her boyfriend are currently stuck in Brussels because Eurostar will not let them change their train time unless they pay 260 euros on top of what they already have paid. No leeway for a difficult personal circumstance. They have nowhere to go, no money and her boyfriend has been unwell. DO NOT USE THIS TERRIBLE COMPANY.An update: after waiting all day for their original train, found it to be delayed with no explanation. Herded into a small room like sardines and no screens there to view. No staff giving any information. What an awful company. Definitely better to fly!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-04-17T20:26:59Z	Regular traveler	I am a regular traveler on the eurostar (once a month) and their service is pricey and terrible. Unfortunately there is no other choice. Their website and booking process improved but is still bad.The staff is incompetent, the security check is extremely slow and not trustworthy (does not work). The waiting lounge are crowded, people sit around on the floor.And if you are ever delayed on their service, the compensation is a joke ( £15 voucher for 2 hours delay or 100 points on their loyalty program... What?).	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-04-17T20:26:59Z	Horrible After - sales services and Customer - Care Services	It seems as if they just do not want to refund your money and once a process of refund is initiated u would expect it to be taken care of and receive your money in stipulated time. But do not be fooled by what they claim on their website. I have had to call them 3 times and they every time I have called them in intervals of a week I was told that they do not know why it's not processed and they will have to initiate it again. It seems as if they want to delay this process on purpose or they do not want to pay you back your own money altogether. I cant trust the words written on their website or the words spoken by the customer services team over the phone.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-04-17T20:26:59Z	EuroNOstars!	"What a complete debacle Eurostar's ""Customer service"" has proven to be. We were left stranded outside of Brussels - for nearly 3 hours, despite the fact we were only 10km away from the station. There was no information, no explanation and no standard of care. The poor ground staff were given no advice and guidance from their company and the train was full of distressed children and elderly people - including a disabled person who was reportedly having difficulties as the air was getting more and more muggy. Conflicting information was eventually fed back to us - including complete lies from the Eurostar twitter team. No compensation has been offered - no apology was made. When I eventually looked through the website myself the computer informed me I would be entitled to £14.50.......it is insulting. We lost hours of our holiday, missed connecting trains on the way back with another delay. Then were told that we could have an E-Voucher?! No thank you - I have no desire to travel on your service again. We were dumped on the old trains each time - there was no protocol with how to deal with the distressed passengers. No meal or sustenance was provided. Only one poor guard dealing with the train as all other Eurostar attendants hid from the clearly confusing situation. Then to have a condescending and unhelpful customer service politely tell me all the ways they will rip me off as a consumer. My train on route home was also delayed meaning that we would miss another connection - it was just over an hour late - but Eurostar are trying to argue it was 55 minutes late. Yet again - shoddy customer service and communication."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-04-17T20:26:59Z	I'm pretty disillusioned with Eurostar	"I'm pretty disillusioned with Eurostar. I've been to Brussels and Paris, both returns in the last few weeks. Three out of the four trains were late, two very late. One was two hours late and they offer a measly £7.50 refund. At no point has the wifi worked enough to even realistically do emails. The food in the on board cafe is horrible. I had a ""chicken caesar"" wrap on the way back from Paris which was really soggy, no flavour, just chicken, lettuce and soggy wrap. And it said ""use by"" the following day - to think what it would have been like after another day!For me, check in and boarding has been fine. But the ticket purchase was also difficult, with problems with the website. Eurostar - you really need to get some new management.I'll fly unless there's a very good reason not to."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	2
2018-04-17T20:26:59Z	İf Eurostar cancel your trip because of…	İf Eurostar cancel your trip because of weather conditions and you didn't print your tickets before they cancelled from Amsterdam to London and there is  no options for printing your ticket including Thalys ticket, but when you call Eurostar customer service, they say we canceled only Brussel to London and you can still get Thalys train but if they cancel your trip you cant access your Thalys ticket anymore on the Eurostar website and Eurostar's website say call customer service, customer service say go to Amsterdam Central station and pickup your Thalys ticket but there is no option to collect ticket because it dosent show on the system. Because they cancel your booking number and Thalys ticket under the this booking number because you booked through Eurostar web site. No one could get access to my Thalys ticket and print at Amsterdam station because of cancelled booking number. During a total of 90 minutes of calling time over 3 times with customers service they told me , i had to buy another ticket with Thalys get to Brussels. Why should I have to pay for another ticket when Eurostar canceled my Thalys ticket. Guys when you buy ticket from Eurostar you have to print immediately otherwise if they cancel and you didn't print your ticket before you can't access your Thalys ticket for print or download.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

The queues at Paris Gare du Nord were horrific.  My connecting train was delayed but I arrived at Gare du Nord with a good half an hour to check-in.  The queue to check-in took over 40 minutes.  And then had to wait another 40 minutes to find out with 5 minutes to go that I had been reassigned a seat in the next, modern train to London.  Something needs to be done about the Paris check-in.  It was also very poorly sign-posted.  But that new train was really comfortable.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	2
2018-03-04T14:40:59Z	Delays, more delays and no wifi for standard	It is winter time and it seems impossible for Eurostar to have my train leaving on time. This is the second Friday in 2 weeks where I will be 30 minutes delayed (but no compensation, while it represents a 25% time increase of the journey). My husband travelling last WE had no more luck.I don't understand why on earth they have the Paris and Brussels trains leaving at the same time. Why not 18:15?? That would reduce congestion at passport control. And there seems to be much less trains on Friday evening too which is stupid. For those who complained about wifi never working, it is very simple. It does not work if you travel standard. Every time I happen to be in S. Premier, it works. Could Eurostar just stop advertising a service they only provide to some customers?Finally, on the points robbery for the loyalty program, I also fully agree with Jeffrey Tribe. I am a platinum member or equivalent on a few airlines, and I have never seen my points erased. AF is revamping their loyalty program and I am still Platinum - thank you very much. Much to think about Mr Felonious Gru. Given the price you have to pay for such poor service, I may also like many others fly instead of taking the train. Or not go as often back to Paris. Sorry Eurostar.  Either way you lose $$$.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-03-04T14:40:59Z	Very poor Eurostar experience!	Recent Eurostar experience has been a complete joke. Left London on a Friday morning train which was over 90 minutes late. Missed the meeting in Paris I was scheduled to go to. The departure area at st pancras was complete chaos and they stopped letting people through to prevent over crowding.The return leg from Paris was equally painful. The queue was so big it was snaking all over the ground floor of the station and took over 1 hour to get through. The facilities at Gard du Nord are not setup to handle large amounts of people and made the whole experience stressful. The train had to leave 20 minutes late as most passengers hadn't made it through security in time.Furthermore, the train arrived into London 1 hour late due to track problems approaching the channel tunnel.I must stress this is completely unacceptable for a major piece of transport infrastructure to operate in this way and desperately needs addressing by Eurostar senior managers.In future I will be flying to Paris from London city airport; less stress, cheaper fares and more reliable service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-03-04T14:40:59Z	Eurostar- forget it!	Shocking experience in gare de nord on our way back to London. Clearly the set up is absolutely not capable of processing a large train load of people that turn up between half hour and an hour before the train is supposed to leave! Hundreds of people in mass queues taking 45 minutes to get through check in, then French passport control, then uk passport control, then security, then another queue waiting for boarding! Awful experience! Not to mention our train out to paris was delayed by 90 minutes due to the train coaches not turning up from the depot! Shocking!!I won’t be going anywhere near Eurostar again that’s for sure - back to flying for me!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Awful, rude, violent and horrendous experience.

2018-03-04T14:40:59Z	Carte blanche to erase your points - no loyalty no doubt!	"Update 11/03: Eurostar finally agreed to take into account points earned from trips made before the introduction of Club Eurostar. However Eurostar will not re-calculate status points from previous trips using the new system, it will just consider the status points earned under the previous scheme. This is unfair because status points under the previous scheme were harder to accrue but the point threshold to reach Carte Blanche status was much lower.     *******************I have been so frustrated by my dealings with Eurostar over the past month that I have created an account on trustpilot to share my experience. I am also hoping that enough people complain to force Eurostar to change its mind on the reset of all Carte Blanche status points following the introduction of its new ""loyalty"" scheme (Club Eurostar - a very e(xc)lusive club indeed). The trustpilot review posted by stephenbriars on Club Eurostar / Carte Blanche is spot on. I also find that Jeffrey Tribe's comment that the new loyalty scheme must have been designed by Felonious Gru hits the nail on the head - you have to wonder who at Eurostar decided it was a good idea to alienate some of Eurostar's most loyal customers by simply erasing all of the points earned towards Carte Blanche status before the introduction of Club Eurostar. Why not just convert the points previously accumulated into the new system?A call and several emails to the customer care department highlighting the obvious flaws of the current scheme have yielded absolutely nothing except for references to the Club Eurostar terms and conditions. However upon review of said terms and conditions (at least the version available on 10 February 2018) I could find absolutely no reference to Carte Blanche status points being reset following the introduction of Club Eurostar - maybe the people who drafted these terms and conditions were trying to thwart Felonious Gru's evil plan? The unhelpful Eurostar representative I was in touch with could not direct me either to the relevant clause.I have seen Eurostar's response to stephenbriar and Jeffrey Tribe that their case was being investigated but I am not holding much hope that this is anything but an attempt by Eurostar to appear reasonable on trustpilot. I will certainly update my review if Eurostar finally comes to its senses. In the meantime - Eurostar you earn one star from me..."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-03-04T14:40:59Z	Poor customer service	I travel on Eurostar almost weekly and frequently I need to change journey and/or ticket. I have constantly encountered poor customer service even after new web site went live. Now I need to change my next journey and the website keeps indicating that no trains run on the selected date. However, if I wanted to buy a new ticket for that same date the website would allow me to do so. As Carte Blanche member I have tried to get in touch with the dedicated telephone number for the last two days without success. No success with general customer service number either. I am growing increasingly frustrated and found myself to spend more on BA lately than on Eurostar. I forgot to mention that the the web chat had been equally unavailable any time I tried to connect to it. Please get your act together!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-03-04T14:40:59Z	Terrible communication and customer service	I travelled with eurostar on 26th December. I called before regarding special assistance as my son is autistic and large crowds/queues etc cause high anxiety and stress and causes him to vomit amongst other things. I was told to arrive 90minutes early and go to the assistance desk and we would be helped. I did this and also took proof of my sons issues with me. The man took one look at my husband and I our 3 suitcases, our 7 year old son, our 2 year old daughter an practically laughed. He said you have him with you to help with children and bags why are you here?We joined the security queue where it was extremely busy and my son vomited into a carrier bag as his anxiety went through the roof. Once through security it wasn't clear where we had to queue. We asked another female operative who mumbles instructions. We politely asked for her to repeat and she raised her voice at us complaining she had already told us where to go once. We also had a small delay and another long queue up stairs to board. All not a problem if you aren't travelling with somebody who's disability controls their feelings. Our son spent the whole journey backwards and forwards to the toilet as he had found everything al so stressful. Not what I wanted for the start of our holiday to Disneyland!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-03-04T14:40:59Z	Eurostar simply doesn’t care about you - nil points.	Eurostar reviewed its frequent traveller scheme in September 2017. It first communicated changes via emails to its customer database in vague and positive terms promoting transfer of its ‘reward’ points on a 1:1 basis. It neglected to inform that it’s tier/status points - to provide benefits for travel - would be reset to zero for all members at launch in December 2017.  For customers who accrued points during 2017 it knowingly issued worthless points during the year without any transparency. In communication with its Customer ‘Care’ team their autopilot response deems this abuse of monopoly both ‘fair’ and ‘a level playing field’ for its customers. Without consideration it penalises and disappoints travellers who have desired to access premium level benefits for frequent or premium level tickets. It’s cursory, ill conceived and ill communicated ‘marketing’ campaign has angered many travellers by erasing their travel history, loyalty, and shows through it's website what appears to be a deliberate intent to remove previous tier status questions from its FAQ sections. Delve into the small print and the Club Eurostar 'terms and conditions' prominently state transition conditions for its reward points, yet omits to inform that status points will be reset to nil. In direct communication it takes a dismissive and unqualified ‘this matter is closed’ stance to queries to avoid resolution. Their approach to customer service suggests a significant backlog of complaints measured only by achieving a ‘cases closed’ metric of success. Further research shows it’s CEO, Nicolas Petrovic, was previously Director of Customer Services which worryingly indicates a detached and dismissive approval of a revised loyalty scheme that alienates it’s most precious and valuable core customers. Eurostar deserves it’s one star status (trust pilot does not offer zero star reviews) for its arrogant approach to customer ‘care’. Lets be clear that Eurostar disappoints in many key customer performance areas, and this subject is just one of many failures highlighting the brand's continued decline. A worthless and disappointing enterprise abusing its monopoly.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

I did not include the booking ref: for security reasons as the journey has still not been completed. The reference I was given during the online chat IS SHOWN within the online chat below (quote: 'Ruxandra: Please provide this reference to my colleagues : 03688012 as I will mention the error you had while trying to change.')Most companies would honour financially, or recompense financially, the problem. NO SUCH CHANCE WITH EUROSTAR. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE YET AGAIN according to Trustpilot reviews!! This is my first time with Eurostar. Usual story 'too big a company to care!!)2nd post (The reply below from Eurostar, asks for references, however if they bothered to read the review of the online chat transcript below, they would see that there is a reference contained within).Original post;I have just come off the phone after speaking with Owen. It took 17 minutes before Owen took the call!Following on from my online chat (see below) yesterday evening, I would have thought that Eurostar would provide a good customer service.I wanted to amend my wife's ticket online which I knew would cost £30 plus the difference in price, which online yesterday evening was about £25, so total to pay would be £55. The problem, as you can see from the online chat below, is that they had problems with their online system, which Owen acknowledged. However, now he quoted me £103.00 to change the ticket!!I asked him if he had read the transcript below, to which he replied yes. Would he not honour yesterday evening's price? No! Why? Because that is what the system is quoting me now! I advised him that is not good customer service, to which he replied, 'you will have to take that up with my employer!! Are you not an employee??Anyway here is the transcript; make your own mind up!!!21:24:38 Ruxandra: Hi xxxxxxx, thank you for getting in touch. My name's Ruxandra.

2018-03-04T14:40:59Z	False pricing advertised on the website	Please be aware that Eurostar website provides false pricing. I was trying to book online, and after I've put all my card details, every time I pressed pay now, the quoted ticket price was going up by £40! They claimed that tickets in this price sold out (even though there were 9 tickets available at this price). After deleting cookies, the old price came back. I tried to book on my phone, other browser etc, and every time the price went up by £40! So they show you one pricing grid and try to scam you when you're ready to book by saying that the tickets sold out (when they clearly didn't). Finally I called the Customer Service and after a while of convincing they said they can book me over the phone for the price quoted. But phone booking costs you £10 extra! This was truly unpleasant experience - please fix your website and don't scam your customers!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-03-04T14:40:59Z	One of the worse customer service is history	Why are the people answering the phones at Eurostar so unhelpful and unwilling to do anything for their customers I will never understand, considering that’s their main job, is shocking how unhelpful some of them are. I am experiencing difficulties to sign in to my account to purchase train tickets, but got of the phone with a man by the name of Dom- and I just felt that he was not interested in helping, and just told me to keep trying to do the same things I told him I had already done but didn’t work, when asked if I could speak to someone else, he said no one else is available right now ... frustrating.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-03-04T14:40:59Z	Pleasant journey	I had a very pleasant experience on the Eurostar Brussels - London - Brussels in December 2017.   Got there 45 mins ahead of departure and queue was not too bad.  Check-in at Brussels Midi was as expected, go through 2 passport controls - one for leaving Belgium and the other for entering the UK. I was in Standard Premier.  X-ray is always a pain though as you have to lift your luggage up onto the belt.  Was served snack / breakfast on board with a croissant, roll, marmalade and butter, juice and coffee or tea.  Also a good selection of newspapers and magazines.Checking in at London Pancras was not so smooth though.  Perhaps due to being so close to the holidays?  Got there a good hour before departure hoping to browse the shops first, but ended up going in the already really, really long queue. Was an overall pleasant journey and great to depart from Brussels center and arrive inside London.  Beats flying hands down.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4
2018-03-04T14:40:59Z	EUROSTAR - A Service Designed by Felonious Gru from 'Despicable Me'!	"Despite the shiny outward image this company attempts to create, there underlies an organisation that is mean, incompetent and totally un-customer foccussed. Since inception of the service some 20 years ago there has been a significant decline in customer service. LOYALTY SCHEMEThe review they have made of their Loyalty programme is shocking - the architect must have been Felonious Gru from 'Despicable Me'. No warning of change, points have been lost overnight and a ridiculous new system introduced where to earn points the booking must be linked to individually named passengers own loyalty schemes. So if booking for your family, you will need multiple Loyalty schemes in place! Add to this the fact that you now have to have 500 points minimum to exchange points for a single ticket and your points are only valid for 12 or 24 moths before they get re-set to zero. Absolutely crazy. A huge marketing and PR blunder. Would be better to simply end the scheme alltogether. CUSTOMER SERVICEReturning from Paris on 2 January my family were treated with rudeness and disdain by a member of their staff controlling the entry point to the check-in. Not good. Not a respectful greeting more a telling off for not automatically going in a direction they required - made to feel like a refugee.BOOKING THROUGH TICKETS TO THE EUROSTAR TERMINALDespite what their website suggests, it's simply not possible to purchase through tickets from Bedford to St. Pancras and then on to other destinations such as Paris - the website won't allow it and Eurostar staff can't make it work either! As consequence, you end up spending a fortune on extra British Rail tickets for the missing leg of the journey! So sad that the facility they used to have in place with a fantastic chap in Cambridge called Bob has gone. You used to be able to buy BR tickets through Bob at excellent rates. Bob was made redundant and he told everyone it was now automated on line but it doesn't work.ON- BOARD WIFI""Sorry sir it doesn't appear to be working""TELEPHONING EUROSTARRecorded music, Recorded music, Recorded music, Recorded music,Recorded music, Recorded music,Recorded music, Recorded music,Recorded music, Recorded music,Recorded music, Recorded music,  - hang-up - Impossible to get through.OBTAINING A REFUND FOR CANCELLED TRAINSVirtually impossible and highly complex because their systems cannot send refund info emails to people with btinternet accounts!Our feelings for this company are rock bottom - we need another operator in place.Hope somebody from Eurostar is listening and will respond!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2018-03-04T14:40:59Z	Poor Software and horrific customer …	Poor Software and horrific customer serviceI am not one to normally write bad reviews but under the circumstances this is needed.Prior to my trip on the 18th Jan to Belgium I have been trying to change my passenger names since Monday this week as for some reason it has mine and my partners first name as the first passenger and our surnames as the second passenger.I have spoken to numerous employees from Eurostars contact centre this week - Early this week I spoke to two men with one directing me to a London number which was incorrect to deal with the problem as he obviously had no idea how to deal with the question and was to lazy to ask. The other employee kept me on hold after explaining the situation and then hung up on me after holding for another 20-30 minutes (in total at this point I have nearly wasted an hour on the phone to Eurostaff staff in my working day).Moving on to Wednesday I spoke to a man called Tabarak who tried to charge me £145 to change the tickets! After a lengthy conversation wanting to speak to management he told me Phil, Josh or Shoaib would call me on Thursday, where of course I didn't receive a call.Today I had to chase up again today where eventually I spoke to Shoaib where we went round in round in circles with the amount to change the tickets would be £131.I explained the simplicity of the situation and the experience I have had with Eurostar staff over the past week... at the least Eurostar should be amending my Booking as a matter of urgency.I have wasted nearly 3 hours of my week speaking and getting scripted information throughout.This is my first time using Eurostar and it has been a horrific service throughout.I am still waiting for a response after two emails and need the situation resolved as I am supposed to be travelling next week!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2018-03-04T14:40:59Z	Unclear check-in procedure and unhelpful staff	I have used Eurostar regularly in the past but have not travelled on it for a couple of years. Changes have been made to the check-in process but this is not in any way clear from the email confirmation, and consequently I was not allowed on the train. I arrived at St Pancras about half an hour before departure (as I had previously always done). I was told that check-in now closed 30 minutes before departure and because I was 5 minutes late, they would not allow me through. I explained that it was not clear from the email confirmation that there was now a hard cut-off at 30 minutes but they still would not let me through, even though the train wouldn’t leave for 25 minutes. I later saw a different staff member allowing someone through who had a train leaving in 15 minutes. The customer service is arbitrary, the passport control infrastructure is inadequate (which causes delays) and there is no attempt to help passengers make the correct train. It is also not clear from confirmation emails that there is intended to be an airport-style cut off for check-in at 30 minutes before departure - although clearly this is dependent on the whim of individual employees.I have previously had a positive experience of Eurostar and I am disappointed by the changes I experienced today.Response to Eurostar’s reply:Thank you for your response. I do not think that your assumption is correct that the people who were allowed to check in 15 minutes before departure were Premier passengers. They were joining the main queue and I believe that Premier passengers have a separate check-in queue. The staff member in question told the passengers in question that they could try to make the train but that she couldn’t guarantee that they would make it. We were not given this opportunity. I maintain that the wording in the confirmation email is not sufficiently clear, particularly for people who are used to the old system. It should state that (i) unless you have crossed the ticket barriers at least 30 minutes before the departure time, you will not be allowed to board the train and (ii) the queues for check-in can be very long and no priority will be given to passengers who have earlier trains.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2018-03-04T14:40:59Z	Rude staff at Kings Cross	I have just had the pleasure of meeting the rudest member of staff at Londons Kings Cross/St Pancreas Premier check in. After panicking all the way here after having trains cancelled or delayed we made it with 40 mins to spare so thought we should just about make it. Until we met their horrendous member of staff. She complained to us that we were late and that we might not get in. So I was panicking and said 'ok lets try the gate' she replied by saying that if I was going to be like that I had to go to the ticket office and then would not give my tickets back when I asked her. I then tried to take them back and she snatched them away and told me not to snatch... my own tickets. She then started swearing in french. I eventually had to speak to a less irrational member of staff which seemed to change the womans mind and she gave our tickets back. The whole time she complained that she had been working since 4am and that people were late and rude to her. She obviously shouldn't be working in a customer based job. Horrendous customer service and would rather swim the channel than use Eurostar again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-12-10T18:46:41Z	On Eurostar from London to Paris	On Eurostar from London to Paris, on time and friendly service. From Paris to London, we arrived 30 mins before departure as suggested. We were ushered into a queue with people with all sorts of timed tickets. They called out 7.13 train and were shocked to find at least 15 people still in the queue at 7.00. they made a poor effort of prioritising those with the earliest train time. We arrived to find we were already allocated to the next train with 5 mins to go before departure. No apology was offered and no real effort was made to get everyone on their allocated train even when we arrived on time. Sadly, Eurostar Paris were unable to fulfil the basic requirement of their service. Organising people to board the train.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	2

2017-12-10T18:46:41Z	Sharp Practice	Spent even more time explaining to their customer services what had happened, because I thought it was a technical error, however they admitted that they keep changing the price, especially if they have just a few seats left. It was like getting a trolley full of food at a supermarket only to be told at the checkout that they are raising all the prices of the food in your trolley because you took the last items off the shelf.  Sharp practice and very poor.  I would strongly recommend that anyone wanting Eurostar tickets buys them via Last Minute.com as this was honest and easy compared with Eurostar website.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2017-12-10T18:46:41Z	Out of touch admin fees	I needed to change the weekend we planned to travel from London to Paris, for myself and my husband.  I was fully expecting some sort of admin fee, but the fees I learned about were ridiculous.  £30 per person, per leg of the journey.  So to change our tickets to another weekend, we would have to pay £120!  This is 80% of the ticket price.  This is not representative of the amount of work involved, and I don't understand how anyone can think this is a normal charge.    I was so disconcerted that I didn't even both to change it and just left it.  What an absolute waste and has left nothing but a sour taste in my mouth.  I will always think twice about eurostar again, and where possible will opt to fly.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

The queue for security takes over one hour but they say only allow an hour there is very little control of the queue and so lots of people push in and queue jump. If you allow one hour and queue honestly prepare to miss the train and expect no sympathy from the staff.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-12-10T18:46:41Z	Terrible customer service and dishonest staff	We travelled on the Eurostar from London to Brussels and were looking forward to the claim it would only take two hours!  However the train was delayed so we kept waiting and waiting and waiting with no real information about when we would leave.  Eventually we left London and arrived over a hour later than the time stated on out tickets in Brussels.  Naturally I tried to claim a partial refund but the website refused so I contact Eurostar but did not receive a reply for over 6 weeks (from my query on 4 September to their response on 19 October). I believe they are obliged to reply within four weeks so it appears they are trying to delay the response so I am almost outside of their 60 day refund deadline.Their response was the train was only delayed by 37 minutes so I have asked them to justify the time as this is a completely dishonest lie.  Our train was due at 12.02 but arrived at 13.10 so I cannot honestly see how they can claim the train was only delayed by 37 minutes!   Of course, they have not replied so it appears I will need to complain to the governing bodies as they seem to think they can abuse their customers with lies.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Not sure how refunding a cancelled train is compensation? Isn’t it illegal to take money for a service you do not provide? Hence doesn’t sound like compensation!!!

From the UK (and to/from UK destinations other than London), we must use eurostar.co.uk which is A DISASTER. It rejects your card for no reason, then changes the prices, then once you pay for a trip and try to reserve for another one suddenly there are no trains anymore (for the whole of November 17!, in more than 2 weeks)... (which I perfectly know is not true after having checked on other booking sites)It is full of bugs. I will have to wait until tomorrow probably to book my next trips, until maybe their computers get cool again.Last, your trips are NEVER recorded on your account until you ask it explicitly.

2017-12-10T18:46:41Z	My friend and I were looking for a …	My friend and I were looking for a daytime fare from London to Paris on Nov 7, 2017 and there were no fares for $61, which was the cheapest fare, available. We ended up reserving for a train that would put us in Paris almost at midnight for that price. The ticket was bought last week, and all of a sudden, last night, it appeared that there was a daytime train for the price, after all. We went ahead and changed the time and date for a train that put us in Paris around 11:30am, but we had to pay $48 penalty per person to switch it. Really Eurostar? What kind of predatory tactic is this? I see that the penalty information is visible right before you make the change, but at the end of the day, it is inconceivable to feel OK about paying pretty much for two extra tickets, when all we wanted was to get to Paris at a decent time; and to top it off, you state that if the price is higher at the time of the change, you have to pay the penalty PLUS the difference in fare, BUT if the new fare is lower, then NO  refund would be issued. I mean, regardless of your business reason for doing so, it really hurts to be out almost $100 to exchange a ticket for a different time on the same day for the same price. This is shameful! Shameful!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-12-10T18:46:41Z	Getting there at last!	I have used Eurostar several times and saw it as an efficient way of reaching the continent. However, my most recent experience has changed my name somewhat. Granted, I decided to travel Standard Premier from London to Brussels and a week later from Paris back to London. Both were very good but the last journey on 14 October was outstanding. The comfort, food and the staff were very impressive and I hope that they have finally started to get their act together. The terminal in Paris has improved but still does not compare with St Pancras. I just question why they do not give passengers more time to board at the ST Pancras end. Overall, I have to give them credit for the improvement and hope that the trend will continue.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4

Used the online chat who told me after some time they could do nothing and I’d have to call in the morning, didn’t tell me whether what I saw was ok, this is how system works or whether this was an error. Called customer services this morning and seems my 9 minute wait to get someone on the line was very good compared to the time some people have waited. The customer service rep said this is not the first time he’d seen this (then why isn’t it fixed) suggested it could be auto fill (then why were there variations in the single name?) and why did I see three distinct names in the entry boxes? The rep cancelled my booking and entered for new tickets but no idea if the insurance I took out or the food I ordered is still valid??	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

You can only take your bike on trains to Paris , Lille and Brussels - that's all. ( forget about going to Calais etc .. they aren't interested). There are many restrictions and contacting them is difficult. You have to buy the passenger rail ticket first with Eurostar  - then contact a second company called EuroDespatch to book your bike ( hoping that there is space for the bike on the same train ).

No acknowledgement nor any reply. Tried phoning three times and gave up waiting. After  a week I went to the eurostar office at St Pancras. They said they couldn't help with the online system. Normally they would ring but they don't bother now as its an hour wait. Suggested I wait longer for a reply. I waited another week and sent a further email titled formal complaint. Still no response. I'll give St Pancras another go as I'm still £176 out of pocket.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Why sell peanuts . There are so many sufferers out there . Choose another snack that isn't life threatening for some please .	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-09-28T18:51:58Z	Totally unacceptable	Totally unacceptable, i have emailed Eurostar twice in past 2 weeks and rang them. No response from email and no answer on the telephone.  I have a serious complaint about extremely noisy and disruptive behaviour on their train... to make about my journey back from Brussels to London.  Very poor indeed.  UPDATE, after a public response on here from Eurostar themselves, informing me they will be in contact shortly...STILL NOT A WORD FROM THEM.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-09-28T18:51:58Z	I'm furious!	"I'm furious!I accidentally added the wrong surname to my sisters ticket (autocomplete) and have been trying to get hold of Eurostar to get this changed ever since. Spoke to someone over email who told me I needed to get hold of customer service and gave me 2 numbers to call. both numbers had me on hold for over and hour so eventually gave up and tried to call another day etc etc.A few weeks later I emailed back to say that I'm having no joy with the phone lines and asked if this change could be done over email or if my sister would still be able to travel with the name incorrect on the ticket, I received a pretty blunt response ""the name must match the ticket, this cannot be done over email""I thought it couldn't get any worse, I was wrong. I finally get through to a customer service consultant today who cannot help me in the slightest, hints its my fault for waiting so long to change the ticket and if I'd called sooner it would have been possible! like I haven't tried!! no choice but to buy another ticket which is unnecessary!I cannot even explain how furious I am, customer service bringing me to tears and ruining this whole trip for me, my mum and sister. unfortunately I'm unsure if my sister will be able to travel now as we cannot afford another ticket.annoyingly the line was cut off before I could speak to a manager so I'm on hold once again to try get this resolved."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-09-28T18:51:58Z	NO Customer Service! Appalling!	The customer service is absolutely appalling! Cistoner Service simply do not respond to the phone calls, every time holding between 30-60 minutes before giving up. Complained by the email, all I could get is that we have forwarded your complaint to the management and sorry nothing I can do.Simply no words!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-09-28T18:51:58Z	Honesty not the best policy	We recently travelled to Paris with my mum for her 70th birthday. She was visiting from South Africa. When my husband booked the tickets he mistakenly booked them all in our family name. When I printed the tickets I discovered the fault and phoned to try recipe the situation. I had to book a new ticket at twice the price. No effort to make it easier . An absolute rip off! To make it worse my honesty was necessary as no one ever checks the name on a ticket with your passport.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-09-28T18:51:58Z	On 16th September I was booked to go …	On 16th September I was booked to go from London to Brussels on eurostar.- 1week before travelling  I hurt my back so,at 76 years of age decided I had better book assisted travel.On arriving at  euroster terminal I went to assisted travel booking in desk,there was no one manning the desk but the one other passengers in front of me had spoken to him but said he had been called away.No problem there was a good hour before departure.A German couple arrived needing a wheelchair,still no one to help.4 chairs on the other side of the barrier had to be accessed by the able German passenger since her husband had health problems and could not stand.More passengers arrived.No sign of any staff.One member of staff walked through and removed the barrier,myself and the German lady sat down.Another elderly gentleman joined us.The queue grew longer.Passengers were boarding my train,eventually a member of staff from business class came and assured those travelling to Paris at 11.30 would be boarded. At that point I stated a number of us were waiting to board the Brussels train which was due to leave in less than 10 minutes.Miraculously  a wheelchair arrived and myself and the German couple were rushed through baggage checks etc.The handlers were not prepared to give any assistance with luggage and again the business class staff member and the German lady came to my assistance.On reaching the lift there was no room for me and I was ordered (I do mean ordered)to follow another member of staff onto an escalator.No help at all was given with luggage until I complained.We then had to rush down the platform. Neither experience helped my bad back and I was back on painkillers.Ithe would have been an easier experience to go through check in in the normal way,at least we would have had access to toilets and coffee and possibly seating.A bad start to a holiday.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

So rude and never had such a bad service ever.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-09-28T18:51:58Z	Never again	The online booking site brought back no results for London to Avignon 3 times.  Phone lines very busy so booked online via Gare Du Nord, The from Gare Du Lyon to Avignon and returns.  Eurostar does not provide sufficient seating for even half of the passengers at any station on these routes so even if you have mobility problems like 2 of my party have, tough luck!The trip out was not too bad but on arrival at Gare Du Nord the only available ticket machine we found with English was faulty causing long queues.  The RER is to be avoided where possible, huge stations, insuffient signage and no service.  It took so long to obtain tickets we only just made our connection.The return trip started off badly with one person being ill, which delayed our departure just long enough for us to see our train leave just as we entered the station.We informed the ticket clerk that we needed replacement tickets to St Pancras and she could have booked us on a direct train but chose instead to put us on the same route back.  The original price for 3 people return was €899, the replacement ticket for the return was charged at €890 - one way!  She allowed 1.5 hours time to transfer through the RER but no sooner had we booked the ticket than they announced a 25 min delay!Both of the next trains were delayed and we were told our train was next so we waited on the platform and boarded the next train.  There was some confusion as our seats were apparently double booked and there was no one around who spoke much English.  Some passengers tried to help and told us we were on the right train but when we left the station it was realised that we weren't.  Too late to do anything about it then we ended up sharing 2 seats between 3 of us.There were no rail staff on the platform we could have asked either.The RER was another nightmare, long queues for tickets.  On arriving at Gare Du Nord, massive concourse over several levels, no signs for Eurostar.  Finally found our way with 15 minutes before departure.  Long queues at passport control for the later train but we managed to find a rail employee, explain about the delay from Avignon and he was going to take us through but they closed boarding before he could.  Back to ticket office to change for next available train, one seat in ticket office, 20 minute queue.  At least we didn't have to pay for new tickets!Staff were reasonably helpful when you could find them, at least in Gare Du Nord.  Avignon staff were not rude, but not as well trained as expected, initially quoted €130 for replacement tickets, no explanation as to why the were €890.  For the prices charged you would expect a far superior service but what you get falls far short.  We chose Eurostar because we thought it would be an enjoyable cross country trip but it turned out to be extremely stressful and ruined the entire weekend.I am bilingual but don't speak French - I will not use French public transport again unless I have no option or manage to learn enough French beforehand.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2017-09-28T18:51:58Z	Terrible customer service	"Having traveled with Eurostar for more than 5 years, their customer service has badly worsen over the years. - Compensation policy has become terrible, where only delays of more than 1 hour are now compensated,whereas it used to be 30 min - note for Eurostar: like Thalys and a number of UK train companies operating under the 'Delay Repay' system. - Members of staff of the French call center are not French native speakers anymore and even struggle to speak sometimes. - call centers are now totally useless. Only here to tell you that they cannot do anything about your complaint as you have to do it online.- once complaint is done online, they apparently can take 22 up to 28 WORKING days to reply now due to ""high volumes of emails"" (complaints?...)My recent experience (reference  #03324701): I had to pay a £30 fees to change my tickets although I arrived at least 15 min before departure, nobody was queuing and the train turned out to be half an hour delayed so I actually got to pay £30 fee to take the exact same train. Unbelievable !"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-09-28T18:51:58Z	They don't care about customers! Why would they its a monopoly!	I have to travel with Eurostar because I am French and work in London so I have have more than 10 years experience in taking the Eurostar at least monthly. THEY HAVE THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!They don't care if you spend thousands of EUR per year in their crappy services. When they are late the refund is always ridiculously small. Then they give you voucher you can't use on their website so you have to call them and wait at least 20 min every time. When they know you want the to redeem the vouvher then the conversation conveniently cut after you've been waiting so long, hoping you will give up. I don't count the number of times when they refuse to give you points for your purchases. And don't get me started on their rip off pricing policy. If want to travel last minute well it's almost cheaper to fly to NYC. Can't wait for this monopoly to end!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-09-28T18:51:58Z	This is the worst customer service …	This is the worst customer service based company ever only interested in your money not your needs,not sour grapes just sick that I had no option but to pay extra €480 for a train when they ( eurostar) said I had plenty of time to catch a connecting tgv they booked.  even when one of the party was 73 not a marathon runner 4 other adults cases and being put on last carriage of train and along with the hundreds of other people leaving the train trying to go places don't believe them when they say you have 50 min till your other connection plenty time they know how busy it is they book it for you remember but when you miss the tgv it's your fault they were busy worst company ever do yourself a favour fly, first and last they don't care really don't care personally think they and the tgv are in it together to well rehearsed it's obviously not there first time they have shafted someone seriously stay clear fly or drive I do it all the time fancied a change mmm guess what I'm in charge now of my holiday not some company out to ruin it	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-09-28T18:51:58Z	It all started so well ....	"Very enjoyable journey from London - Paris. The check-in was smooth, the waiting time short, the train modern and very comfortable. The return journey was the complete opposite for a number of reasons. First, the waiting area at Gare Du Nord was overcrowded, uncomfortable and all-round poorly designed. Second, 10 minutes before boarding time we received an announcement that we had to evacuate the waiting area designated for London-bound passengers. What followed was nothing short of chaotic and distressing (particularly in the current political climate) - little direction from the staff present led to hordes of confused and anxious travellers going in all directions, knowing that they have to evacuate but not knowing how and where to.  As the crowd gathered round the couple of unlucky members of staff on duty we were left there waiting with no further information on the evacuation. 10 mins later we were able to board the train. We'll never know what the evacuation was about. We're now leaving 25 minutes late on one of the older ""Vintage"" model trains that comes sans wifi. All in all the train looks like it should have been retired many moons ago. It has a very tired interior (and I'm in Standard Premier) - the pocket holder staring me in the face hangs limply from one side, having been detached/torn on one side, no doubt by a frustrated customer. It's actually kind of funny as it serves as a kind of visual metaphor for the return leg experience served up by Eurostar. It's a real shame as we've otherwise had a fantastic weekend in Paris! **Update - just been served a nice dinner, unfortunately it came with a filthy  wine glass. Sometimes you have to laugh- what else is there to do."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-09-28T18:51:58Z	There is always light at the end of a tunnel	Shame Eurostar seems to have a bad rep, but nothing can be better than the experience of booking over the phone. This gentleman was fantastic. I was booking a trip to Lyon and he knew the city so well, giving me tips while completing the booking. What a great experience. Also was able to warn me of engineering works that were happening which allowed me to change my mind on dates (online didn't mention this). Additionally how the passport control works on the way back (apparently need to get off the train somewhere on the way and get the passport checked and get back on board). Wish I got his name - legend. Value for money wise, if you want a better experience I suggest travelling Premier Economy. I only travel in this class and have always received ok service (some onboard staff need to be friendlier I think). It's often not much more expensive than standard economy so check it out.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4
2017-09-28T18:51:58Z	Travelled back from Paris to Ashford …	"Travelled back from Paris to Ashford Kent on 6 August 2017 on ES9045.Presumably, as I was in steerage, I was treated with impoliteness and rudeness by a Eurostar Staff member.I had only paid the miserable sum of £450 for the return journey (for my wife, son and myself) - so I guess I should not have been expecting to be addressed as ""Sir"" or to have the word ""please"" suffixed to questions or demands. Obviously, a better standard of customer service is reserved for celebrities travelling in in Premier Class.This isn't the first time that I haven't received courtesy from this company.As I live in Ashford, and visit relatives in Paris - Eurostar has always been an attractive option...but... I am really beginning to hate this company. In future, I'll take the ferry and put up with the drive.Honestly, to all those considering travelling standard class on Eurostar, think well before sacrificing your self-respect for a few hours off journey time."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-09-28T18:51:58Z	Avoid by all means	A horrible service, extremely expensive and operated and designed with the worst possible way to rip off the passenger/client.No refund, no pets allowed, small seats, very expensive tickets almost always oh and by the way there's a 30£ charge fee plus the difference in case you change your mind about your ticket.Thanks but I'll head to the airport next time. AVOID.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-09-28T18:51:58Z	Traumatised	"TraumatisedI arrived at the Gare du Nord station on Sunday at approximately 1730 to board my train back to St Pancras where there are no clear signs regarding details of Eurostar check in and no help points. Having read online that the standard waiting time is 30 min I ensured to arrive on time for check in. To my shock and horror, I arrived to a chaotic scene with endless queues and panicked people with heavy bags and suitcases. The queue consisted of travellers for three different trains, one for 18 13 departure, one for 18 43 and one for around 19.13 with nowhere to sit. Their systems had clearly failed and we had to queue really far. I asked a lady holding up a sign whether I was missing my 18.13 am train at least 3 times and she told me I was on the right queue and to get back in the queue. As time passed, I panicked more and more. Eventually reaching the check in, I ran up another lady and showed her my tickets. She informed me that I was few min late and that the check in was closed. She advised me that I should buy a new ticket from SNCF. They were not taking responsibility for their chaotic system but wanted me to pay for a new ticket and had clearly rehearsed a speech. I was pleading with her that I am extremely busy and must be back in London asap. I also pleaded with her as my mother was clearly unwell and was not fit to wait any further having queued up forever. There were nowhere to sit and my mother simply collapsed on their floor in despair. The lady would not even listen to me and just held her hand up and told me to book new tickets. She marked my tickets ""17 53"" and asked me to go to the ticket office. I find it puzzling that she marked my ticket with the time at that time rather taking into account the fact that I had already been waiting patiently in the queue.I looked for the person who told me to purchase new tickets, however she was extremely rude and claimed she had no clue when their own ticket office would be opening or whether there would be any seats left for the 18 43 train. I then managed to find the ticket office and stood in the queue in a state of panic to purchase new tickets. Despite the chaos, only one person was working in the ticket office. I managed to obtain new tickets and was told that I must pay 80 euros. No explanation as to why this sum or why I have to pay. I received my new tickets at 18 10 as marked on the receipt. Whilst waiting in the queue, I spoke to three others who were also forced to purchase new tickets despite arriving well in advance. I find this a ploy to make money in a situation where clearly the management is non-existent.  Despite my new tickets, I just about made the new train for 18 43. The queue and the security check in was beyond catastrophic and I was distressed for the entire duration. This only demonstrates the mismanagement of Eurostar. Having read some of the reviews online subsequent to my experience, I note that this is a common phenomenon with Eurostar. I have been traumatised and left sick after my return from Paris.  I find this to be completely unacceptable, irrational and unfair. Rather than offering me a clear and calm explanation, the staff was extremely rude, blunt and unsympathetic. They raised their voice, gave me orders, spoke to me in an evidently angry tone and refused to offer any form of apology or assurance despite seeing that I was distressed. Moreover, I am convinced that Eurostar is making money by targeting vulnerable people in an attempt to generate more money. This should be brought to the attention of the press and media. People should be deterred from using Eurostar."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-09-28T18:51:58Z	Good old bad customer service	Purchased an interrail global pass for the both of us, having realised you can now use interrail on Eurostar, so I decided to look into booking some reduced price tickets, only to realise you need to call the customer service line and book with an agent, which i thought was a bit 1994. They don't pick up the phone after being on hold for several hours over a 3 day period. I decided to book tickets at the full price as i could'nt get to an agent to book me on with interrail discount. I eventually got hold of someone who I thought was rather cold and abrupt when i asked her to refund me my tickets and rebook me with my interrail pass discount, she would'nt help me out whatsoever, even though i had said i could'nt get hold of anyone as i was on hold for hours over 3 days.  Shocking customer service, but i suppose when a company has the monopoly of running international rail services, customer service does'nt come into it. In my experience, when everything works on Eurostar, its a pleasure. But when it goes wrong, the old chesnut of bad customer service rears its head. I remember a few years ago, we slowed down at Dollands Moor and stopped just outside the channel tunnel for 75 minutes, with no explanation given for the delay. We are not idiots, tell us there is a failed train infront of us or a points failure.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	2
2017-07-26T22:18:56Z	Fly, swim, drive or just don't go	the website is misleading and claims the tickets you wanted are no longer available after a lengthy purchasing process, I have periodically  checked said tickets availability and low and behold they are there a week later. I am down £100 and will probably have to pay more in rebooking fees. Polite questions and complaints are dealt with in a brick wall manor, Eurostar has your money and no longer wants to have anything to do with you.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-07-26T22:18:56Z	Welcome back to the 1990's	When we booked our first ever trip and seats on the Eurostar, we didn't know that it was a theme park ride. Honestly it was so nostalgic to revisit how things were in the 1990's. when power outlets were considered an optional extra for the rich and famous, when wifi was a pipe dream for science fiction buffs and when brown and grey seat coverings were seen as minimally futuristic. The customer service and helpfulness also hark back to the last century. Was really looking forward to this trip the next time I go to Disneyland Paris, might try a steam boat instead.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-07-26T22:18:56Z	Worst experience on Eurostar	I arrived half an hour early for the Paris to St Pancras. Their systems had failed and we had to queue really far. I asked a lady holding up a sign whether I was missing my 7.13 am train at least 3 times and she told me I was on the right queue and to get back in the queue. At check in they said I was late and that I should buy a new ticket for 200 Euros from SNCF. They were not taking responsibility for their broken systems but quickly wanted me to pay for a new ticket. I looked for the manager who told me I could pay 40 Euros to catch another train but they had no clue when their own ticket office would be opening! What a strange state of affairs! Definitely some sort of scam  going on.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-07-26T22:18:56Z	Must improve on free service	I travel a lot for work and use Eurostar very oftenPositivesTrains are always spotless, the ride is smooth, there are plugs for each seat and there is enough space for your legs.Must be improved- The temperature in the older trains is ridiculously cold. Especially if you have a window seat. - The wifi NEVER works. If you can't provide enough band for the entire train, don't advertise it, it's so frustrating- snacks and drinks are overpriced, the quality and quantity is not matching the value.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3
2017-07-26T22:18:56Z	Not recommend! Poor customer services and rude agents.	I do not recommend!!!! Very bad customer service experience!After they let you wait on hold, when you finally get in touch and explain your issues, they shut your phone without saying at least 'bye. I brought 2tickets from London st Pancras international to Paris and one of the traveler's name is wrong. I am sure that I fill out the form correctly but when I submitted I realized that instead of my husband's name is our baby's name.  And he is just a baby, he will stay on my lap anyway and they asked me now to buy another ticket.  You can do changes everywhere when you do bookings...train, flights ...but not on their website. I wanted to pay a fee for this but not even like that it's possible.  Shame on you, Eurostar! I will never use your services anymore! Very disappointed:(	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-07-26T22:18:56Z	Poor customer service	Me and my partner paid £300 each for tickets from Nice to St Pancreas. Train from Nice to Paris Gare De Lyon was delightful. Then we had to catch a train from Gare De Lyon to Paris Nord station, which was not clearly notified at all on the Eurostar website when we booked the tickets. We realised this on the train to Gare De Lyon so we realised we had to change station. This was a nightmare, no one spoke English and all the signage was in French. After finally getting to Paris Nord and into the Eurostar queue we were told we were 3 minutes late to check in. Went to the ticket office who tried charging £40 each to be put on the next train which was  1 hour later. Explained to the staff that there was no way that we could have got from one station to the other due to our circumstances and language barriers any faster and having paid for premium tickets we thought that been 3 minutes late was very mean, especially with the price we paid. They refused to listen to anything we had to say, and tried to make it our own wrong doing. Once we were on the train all was well though, on time and friendly staff. A very stressful experience with poor customer service, could so easily have been a pleasant journey.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	2
2017-07-26T22:18:56Z	Queued for over 2 hours at Gare de Nord …	Queued for over 2 hours at Gare de Nord station.  No Eurostar staff to tell us why, no water handed out, nowhere to sit etc.  Once checked in we had to board immediately, no time to get something to eat or drink (unless you want to buy something on the train, which I would advise you avoid).  Customer services failed to address my complaint - volume of people when you presell tickets is NOT a valid excise nor is it the reason there were no staff to inform people or the excuse to treat people so badly.  Would NEVER chose to travel by Eurostar again, I'd prefer to spend my time travelling to an airport!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-07-26T22:18:56Z	I'm afraid this is another tale of woe	I'm afraid this is another tale of woe.  My poor son went traveling to Paris with his friends for a break after his A levels.  They arrived half an hour before departure only to be told check-in closed 2 minutes ago.  Particularly galling as the train itself was late.  Staff were unhelpful, disrespectful to the youngsters and rude.  They smirked behind the small print and charged them £30 extra to go on a later train.  Remonstrating with customer service met with obtuse meaningless responses.  My advice is to avoid at all costs, especially if you are a young person on a budget.  Choose either to fly or catch the ferry.  Never had a problem with either of them.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2017-07-26T22:18:56Z	Poor Eurostar experience in Paris	We travelled to Paris via Eurostar on 8th July and returned in 9th July. I was appaled at the poor service in Gare Du Nord on the return. The  queue management for immigration control was amateur at best. We had two children under 4 years and waited in a queue for about an hour only to find that as we got close to the stairs leading up to UK immigration control, at least 6 further queues had formed and people were jostling to get in. Eurostar staff were managing best they could but surely it should be possible for Eurostar to organise the queue to prevent the whole thing becoming farcical. The whole Eurostar experience was spoilt by this episode.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2017-07-26T22:18:56Z	I had a really bad experience with …	"I had a really bad experience with Eurostar. I went onto the website to change my outward journey from London - Paris. After I made all the changes selecting the new date and time, entered my credit card details and pressed submit, the website crashed and came back with an error message. Checking my emails to make sure I didn't get an email to confirm - I re- entered the information and my credit card again. On later checking my emails, I not only received an email for the intial time I tried to change and got an error message, I also received another email which changed my inbound journey back to London which was very strange as I did not even see the return date mentioned. Only having selected the outbound journey to amend. As I was travelling in the US at the time I automatically went onto the online help and communicated to a customer service person what had happened. I was advised by the customer service person to call the helpline to get the change made and I explained that I could not do this as I was travelling on an Australian mobile and the cost to do this would be too high. I asked the customer service representative to make a note on my record that I had been in contact and advised that I would call the customer service  line as soon as I got to the UK. I also sent an email explaining the situation, hoping that I would get a response prior to having to make the call. I followed up by email every day and received not a single reply.When I called the customer service helpline I spoke to someone who said they were looking at what could be done. After being kept waiting for over 30 minutes on the line, I was informed that the only thing I could do was make an amendment at a charge of GBP 30.00 and pay any fare difference / which I was advised was now EUR 170.00. I pleaded with the person explaining that this issue was not my fault and I shouldn't be charged to make the change back to what the ticket was initially only to be told that I should have called the help desk at the time even though I had advised that this was not possible at the time and I had previously mentioned this to the online help person. I also asked why I had not received any response on the email I had sent (over a week ago) and was told that this was due to a backlog of emails ( not something to tell a customer to instill confidence in the service of a company). I believe my treatment and the total lack of understanding on what effective is a Eustostar issue is totally unacceptable. I have had to pay two sets of amendment fees and have got absolutely nowhere as Eurostar refused to make the chance to my ticket -after  actually being told that if my ticket was changed then the company would be loosing EUR 170.00 "" but hangon its my ticket in the first place"" so they are loosing nothing.I have subsequently had to book flights back from Paris due to a lunch commitment I am unable to break and also had to pay for a friends return tickets who I am travelling back with all because Eurostar refuse to make an amendment on what was a problem on their website. I see from some of the reviews that others have experienced issues with the Eurostar website. I am very mis- trusting of using this website again. Eurostar and their customer service team have totally spoilt my trip back to the UK to see my family after two years away. Very unhappy customer who would think twice about using Eurostar. I know   it is easy to get from London to Paris and back however if there are any deviations or issues it's a nightmare to get a response or and sympathy from  this company.Justin Brewer"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-07-26T22:18:56Z	Not enough time alert for first time Eurostar Passage	Going to a romantic trip with my gf from London to Paris, yet found out when we get to the St. Pancras station that the check in closed 30 mins prior to departure.  There's no alert, at least nothing caught my attention when I purchased the train/hotel through Eurostar affiliate partner lastminute.com.  When I re-read the Eurostar print out ticket, there's some very small letters below some ads that tells you this -- who READS everything if there's ads in between; put it to bold or larger words if you really want to alert people.  Then the outcome obvious is we miss the train and miss some of the events we plan to do.  We then go to their ticket counter and they put us to a much later train, and we have to pay extra 30 pound per person.  We wait in line in the ticket counter and there're many people like us miss the train so apparently this is a common issue EuroStar aware, but do nothing to improve it.  Maybe this is a good way for them to collect extra money?Taking the train itself is fine, on time.  Check in is before boarding so after get off you can go straight out of the train station.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2017-07-26T22:18:56Z	Beware the Eurostar ripoff	Travelled to Paris at the end of April. Beats flying. They now have new rolling stock. A lot more comfortable. The trains were looking decidedly tatty the last time we travelled.Now we come to what spoilt the experience. I swallowed the buy your metro tickets on board and save time line. I paid 21 euro's for a book of tickets which cost 15.50 euro's in my timeshare apartments and 14.50 euro's at the station. This put me in a bad mood for quite a long time.Nobody likes being ripped off. I have since heard of some friends having problems with bus tickets. It seems the company did not want to accept the voucher which was also more expensive than the ticket.Eurostar should hang their head in shame. Why spoil an enjoyable experience by ripping people off.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4
2017-07-26T22:18:56Z	Used to be great - not any more	I've been travelling regularly between London & Brussels since 2004 and Eurostar has changed a lot: it used to be great but difficult to book without an agent, then it was even better - easy to book yourself and choose a seat, comfortable and great staff. Over the last few years all this has ebbed away and we're left with just the friendly, efficient staff, a poor website experience and uncomfortable trains. With every update the website becomes more and more difficult to use and the new trains are just horrible. I've sat on more comfortable park benches. Sure they have wifi but that is the sole improvement. Strangely, the refurbished trains are better than the new ones but not by much. If you travel from their Ebbsfleet station you are poorly served since they close the place at lunchtime (the last Brussels train leaves at 13:15) although you can get an evening train to Ebbsfleet. If you have an early morning meeting you have no choice but to travel the morning before. I used to quite enjoy commuting between capital cities but not any more.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	2
2017-07-26T22:18:56Z	Eurostar Shambles!!	"Worst customer service EVER. The company is obviously managed by a bunch of intellectually challenged people.Summary of my ""delightful"" trip to Disneyland: My return journey was an absolute nightm­are. On my ticket and in the email conta­ining my itinerary it clearly states that check in is 30/45 mins before departure Based on this info­rmation I ensured th­at I arrived at the station in time for check in. I arrive at the station where there are no clear signs regarding detai­ls of Eurostar check in and no help poin­ts. I wait outside the Eurostar check in station (which is closed) for 30 mins before it opens and they inform me that for my particular tic­ket I do not need to check in and that I ""need to go downsta­irs"". I then proceed downstairs where I ask the information desk for assistance and they rudely advi­ce that I need to get a non eurostar tra­in. The train to Lil­le then arrives 18 mins late. We arrive at Lille at 5.15pm, leaving me 10mins to check in. The platf­orm was packed and there was no clear si­gnage showing where the Eurostar check in is and no visible staff. In the end I managed to find the check in after asking staff in the FX co­unter. We finally lo­cated the check in to be told that we mi­ssed it by 3 minutes! This has absolutely ruined mine and my daughters trip to Disneyland."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2017-07-26T22:18:56Z	Terrible untrustworthy company who do not honour there word	Travelled recently from London to Paris. Long story short there was a glitch with the system reading my wife's visa (no fault of ours). It would take overnight to resolve the visa issue due to the embassy being on public holiday. As a result the boarder security assured us Eurostar would transfer the ticket. Boarder security took us to the Eurostar desk in which they stated they would transfer the ticket after ping ponging us between multiple staff members. They said they would transfer once the visa issue had been resolved first. The visa issue was rectified overnight as expected and upon returning the next day Eurostar staff refused to honour there word. The treatment and attitude from the desk was the worst I've ever experienced. With my wife in tears they forced us to pay for a new ticket forfeiting our old one. The initial ticket was around 100 pounds for 2 people one way. The man at the counter with a big smug smile requests 395 pound for the new tickets knowing we had no other choice as we'd already spent a fortune in lost accomodation and additional hotel for the night. Absolutely disgusting company. I contacted the Eurostar help online thinking they would be appalled by this staff members attitude and honour the initial agreement but no this company are scum all the way from the top to bottom. Consider this a strong warning DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! FLY SWIM WALK BUT AVOID EUROSTAR AT ALL COSTS!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2017-05-18T16:15:00Z	Eurostar - Can't think of anything worse...	Eurostar is probably the worst traveling experience. Not only those idiots managed to replace old trains with newer ones that offer less comfort, less space and terrible design. Eurostar now has a new scam in place. If you arrive less than 30min before departure, say 28 minutes before the train as it's what happened to me today, they will charge £30 to change your tickets. Obviously they charge for credit card fees on top. It used to be that they would offer some flexibility but they've now realised that their monopoly allowed them to just charge for whatever they pleased. The staff is untrained and odious. My 7-months pregnant wife could explain as much as she wanted that the reason for her 2-minutes tardiness was due to the fact that she was carrying a baby and she could not walk fast but that obviously did not matter. The waiting spaces are nasty and can only remain that way as no cleaning staff can be seen.  On top of that, their trains are most often late and sometimes from personal experience they will put you in the next train when they can't handle their check-in properly. Having no direct competitor, they obviously overcharge all their passengers as my roundtrip for two has now cost me close to £600. Overall I cannot really see any positive for this poorly managed enterprise. I just can't wait for a competitor to arrive. In the meantime, besides telling the world how useless Eurostar is, I feel  powerless.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-05-18T16:15:00Z	BOOKING WEBSITE IS HORRENDOUS	Unfortunately, I need to book many Eurostar tickets for staff members on a regular basis.  The website is HORRENDOUS.  It constantly fails to recognise my log-in details (a fact that a staff member told me happens to them all the time too).  Today, so far I have tried to book the same ticket 3 times and it keeps telling me it cannot accept my payment - it is really the most annoying website to deal with.  If I reluctanly have to call them to book it for me they will charge ME an extra £10 for calling THEM. It is very, very frustrating.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-05-18T16:15:00Z	Beware rip-off exchange rate	The check in process is as smooth as can be expected for international travel these days and certainly better than most airports. However, in 2nd class the legroom is less than mainline GWR services in the UK.The real downside though is the rip-off exchange rate if you are silly enough, or can only pay in euro on a train owned and operated by a French Company. Unaware that the primary price for items was GBP i payed for my coffee and tickets in euro. (remember, this is a French company operating out of the EU). That was a serious error on my part because with the tourist rate around !.14 euro to the pound I was charged at the exorbitant rate of 1.39 to the pound. Not only is this a blatant rip-off, but the price of a carnet of 10 Paris Metro tickes was some 15% dearer than purchasing on arrival in Paris. A double whammy! Be warned, stay out of the Eurostar restaurant car unless you really have no alternative	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3
2017-05-18T16:15:00Z	Inflexible and poor offering for customers	They won't change the destination on my ticket, even if I offer to pay for the amendment - Or passenger details.

I have now lost £200  - and you lost this customer I'm afraid unless you can sort it out :( Looking forward to seeing what you have to say.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-05-18T16:15:00Z	Charlie Macauley	I was queuing at the security thing with my luggage and a large Costa Americano. I was concerned that I would not be able to take my recently purchased, piping hot and much loved coffee through security. However a very kind gentleman named Charlie Macauley allowed me to take the coffee through, and even provided a coffee holder to take the coffee through the security scanner without spilling. He was great banter and a very kind man. He also wished me a happy holiday. Eurostar, please give this man a payrise. Because of him we will most certainly be using Eurostar again, and recommending it to friends. Excellent customer service.

2017-05-18T16:15:00Z	Very bad for travel with tiny tots	Appalling service at Marne le vallee chessy station on Monday 6th March.Our train to Lille Europe (18.52) was delayed and we recieved no guidance from staff that it would be behind a train on the platform. The information board stated our train would be at section H on the platform. It was in fact at section A behind another train. We had to run with a baby, pram and five suitcases and a child. The station staff member blew her whistle and was incredibly rude and watched us struggle. All the staff saw us struggle and yet they locked the doors so we could not get on and then the train went without us!Whilst running my baby and buggy nearly ended up in the gap between the platform and the train!Horrendous service!Two minutes to load with such poor preparation from service announcements and station staff is downright ridiculous, even more so with so much luggage and baby and children and pram. In fact it was downright dangerous!! Had my baby and children ended up on the train without us or left on the platform without us, I would be initiating a lawsuit.We finally arrived home four hours later than planned but at least we were still together. I'm absolutely appalled by the two minute loading time and the behaviour of Marne Le vallee station staff, The outbound journey was not much better either and took a lady leaving her foot in the TGV door so that the train couldn't leave, just so that my husband could get all our luggage off (mainly the baby's dietary supplies!)	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-05-18T16:15:00Z	bad company rip off	i cant believe that euro star charge £30 per person each way to exchange to a different date so that means i have to pay £120 for 2 people just to change my date even though its 1 week away and unfortunately to work reasons, im shocked they they dont do refunds or part exchange without charging a fortune! i wont be using this company in the future id rather miss out then pay the extra fees its ridiculous, we are all not made of money, the staff are absolute helpless people with no sympathy.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2017-05-18T16:15:00Z	The unacceptably rude and selfish behaviour of Eurostar	"I cannot express in words how much I urge you all not to travel with Eurostar. Eurostar is a greedy company obsessed with money and filled with rude and unsympathetic staff. I don't think they have any compassion for their customers and I honestly think they see each one as a walking wallet, rather than a human being with a beating heart.My journey on the way there went smoothly. I was surprised by how easy it was to book the train and how cheap it was. The journey was comfortable. However, this is all a complete allusion and the cheap prices online are completely shadow the ways in which the company try and rip people off. I accidentally booked my return ticket for the wrong date. This was my fault and I was prepared to pay a little extra to change this. I was made to pay almost £200 more for a ticket that originally cost £28 for making a common mistake. This is completely indecent! I do not see how they expect everyone to afford this and I do not see what I person with small financial means would have done in this situation.When I inquired what I should do, the staff member was very frank with me and showed no sympathy or friendliness. I went to the desk. I found out how much I had to pay and inquired as to why it cost so much. Rather than offering me a clear and calm explanation, the staff member was extremely rude, blunt and unsympathetic. They raised their voice, gave me orders, spoke to me in an evidently angry tone and refused to offer any form of apology. This made me feel much more confused and upset. When I stood almost in tears, she did not even great me goodbye or offer any words of consolation or advice. To be honest, I have rarely been treated in this way. I can only compare this sort of behaviour to bullying on the school playground or to being told off as a naughty child by an adult. It is not how a member of staff should have spoken to a 19-year old customer for making a common mistake.I emailed Eurostar several times to complain about this and they persisted in telling me that nothing could be done. What is more, they treated me like a stupid person and implied that I had no knowledge of travel companies. They tried to justify their actions by comparing themselves to other travel companies, but I have not heard of any experiences similar to this with other companies. They have not replied to my most recent email and they have failed to give any reasonable explanation as to the way in which they ripped me off. They even tried to justify the behaviour of their staff members by calling it ""professional"".Wherever you may be travelling, it is absolutely not worth travelling with Eurostar! They have no sense of common decency towards their customers. It is quite astounding!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-05-18T16:15:00Z	Seat to Brussels changed without notification	I've had some very good experiences with Eurostar in the past, but it's going downhill. Extremely annoyed that I wasn't informed they had changed my window forward facing seat that was carefully chosen 3 months ago to a backwards facing aisle seat - apparently they decided to use my original carriage for business class. Why couldn't they e-mail me and let me choose a new seat - or a different train. Eventually I was given a forward facing seat right beside the constantly opening door to the very noisy kitchen car. Really rubbish and not a great start to my EU evaluation week.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	2
2017-05-18T16:15:00Z	The most awful travel experience	I travelled on the Eurostar to and from Amsterdam on 30 December 2016 and 2 January 2017 and was frankly disgusted with the service in its entirety. On 30 December my trip was delayed about 5 hours and all I was offered was a voucher for Eurostar.  I missed a huge amount of time and plans I had in Amsterdam - something that to me is priceless. On 2 January my ticket was scanned by staff onto the wrong train which meant I missed my connection and had to stay overnight at Brussels.  The first customer service desk I went to in Brussels was closing and the staff ignored me whilst I was obviously crying and upset.  The second desk was open but the staff only offered to put me on a free trip at lunch time the next day back to London and wouldn’t pay for accommodation at that point.  I missed work and earning approximately 240 pounds that day because of Eurostar’s incompetence.They still will not give me any compensation and safe to say I will never be travelling with Eurostar again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-05-18T16:15:00Z	Checkin Policy and Horrible Customer Service	Had the worst experience with Eurostar this morning. Horrid way to start your vacation. Suggest flying over using this company any day.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-05-18T16:15:00Z	Never get refund. Useless cutomer service	I tried to surprise my wife bought two tickets to Paris but she unable to travel due to medical examinations. I try to get my money back but they never refund not even extending dates.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-05-18T16:15:00Z	Next time I'll swim across	Gare du Nord is a nightmare even by cheap airline standards - as you ascend towards the Eurostar section you are greeted by nice decor which eventually leads to a queue that I can only describe as a vicious nightmare at best - no structure or organization, and even cattle led to slaughter are treated better. I am being reassured that everyone is in the same position (as if I can't see that for myself) and after inevitably being late (nearly a full hour in the queue), I do not even receive an apology (or an explanation) and am simply handed a ticket for a train an hour later. At least they had the decency to ask whether I would like a 4 seat (with table) or 2 seat placement...I've been told this is one the better experiences on this sub-par service. For the cost and length of time it takes to travel, Eurostar cannot afford to frustrate it's customers like this and for myself is a no go from now on.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-05-18T16:15:00Z	Terrible Customer Service and Signage at Gare Du Nord	Eurostar:- Customer service exceptionally poor: Upon being delayed (we arrived at 1906 for a 1913 departure) due to the French public transport system the attitude of Eurostar staff was 'not my problem', British train or air operators would typically offer a goodwill gesture of unfilled seats on a later journey in this scenario (at no cost to them) - however Eurostar's French staff had no interest in this and instead stuck rigidly to their autocratic conditions of carriage, charging my partner and I an 80 Euro fine, we could barely afford. My partner was in tears by this point, the staff at the booking office showed no compassion whatsoever and coldly informed her she'd have to pay the fine.- Once on the train the train was extremely overheated, I assume as a cynical attempt to sell a greater amount of refreshments and a sliding door between carriages violently shut on my hand, grazing my skin (granted relatively mildly, but this was the icing on the cake by this point).- The train back was an almost constant set of announcements for the buffet, travel tickets onward they sell on board etc. - if this were a Ryanair flight, I wouldn't expect any less - but for a supposedly premium service, this is not what I would hope for.I would strongly advise anyone thinking Eurostar is a cheaper or more convenient experience to flying or boat travel to reconsider, as this experience has certainly put me off for life.Gare Du Nord:-The station has incredibly poor signage. I don't have any particular requirement for signs in English, as I speak passable french - however finding the Eurostar terminal from the RER was extremely difficult involving wandering around the station until finding an exit signed 'mainline' upon leaving in this direction there were eventually signs to Eurostar. Neither 'mainline' or 'eurostar' were signed until this point however. Very very poor.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2017-05-18T16:15:00Z	Never take eurostar again.	On wednesday, myself and 4 other friends went to brussel from london. We booked our tickets to catch the 6.50 train. Unfortunately we got there about 6.25, still 25 mins left to catch the train and it was not busy hours. staff there didn't let us through and each staff kept asking us to see a different staff and no one was a help and they were arrogant and aggressive, it was a disappointment that we have enough time and they were dragging us along. each one of us end up paying extra to catch the next train. we sit there for our next train and the boarding only started 15 mins before the departure. we see people walking in 5 mins before the departure to other trains and we feel that we were picked on and it was unfair. It ruined our morning and our trip, my friends and I wont travel on eurostar again and I wont encourage anyone to travel on eurostar again. they are greedy, rude and arrogant company.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	I had THE BEST experience getting the Eurostar from Lille Europe to London st Pancras!!!	So on Sunday evening I cleverly left my purse in the departure lounge at Lille (last week I left it in the airport in Zurich) and I didn't realise until I was already on my train (I know, I don't deserve to have one). Anyway, the amazingly quick witted managers Stefan and George managed to track me down and accompany my bag on the next train to London! I am so grateful to them and all of the staff. All I had to do was wait in the cushy confines of Pret a Manger, eating my egg mayo sandwich, until my purse was delivered to me in person by Stefan. If that's not great customer service then I don't know what is! In other news, the Eurostar cheese and ham toastie is delicious and the white wine not to Chablis....	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	Awful customer service	"Took over one month to receive response to complaint about on board staff member who was aggressive and rude to me and my husband. The reply said, ""Sorry you FELT you were treated this way"", with no offer of trying to redeem the situation. Eurostar does not value its customers as it knows it has a monopoly in this area. Will be flying to Pairs and/or Brussels next time."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	Don't understand the bad reviews	I've traveled aboard Eurostar between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and I found it convenient and comfortable. It's about as cheap as flying into Stansted, but you end up at St. Pancras, not an hour+ away from London. Haven't had a bad experience with Eurostar and look forward to travel with them again.  My only complaint is that getting to Brussels from the Netherlands is a bit of a pain. Coming from Nijmegen it takes me about 3 hours to get to Brussels, with only 9 minutes to transfer at Roozendaal. That's not really Eurostar's fault though.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	What are people on about? I loooove Eurostar!	I used to work in London and return to my family in Holland a few times a month. There is nothing like the Eurostar. For the same price as a ticket from Stansted, you get to travel straight from St Pancras to central Brussels. The only suggestion I have is to cooperate with Thalys to have one integrated service to the Netherlands. Right now, with all the high speed rail issues we've experienced in the Benelux, it is a right pain to have to change to a slow train from Brussels to the Netherlands. I spend as much time on the Brussels to Holland train as on the Eurostar, despite living on the Dutch-Belgian border (less than an hour by car). That's a true pity. I know you're not the same company, but at least you could start a joint venture for a combines Thalys-Eurostar service!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	Problem in tunnel very badly handled	My train leaving Paris at 19:01 was cancelled because of problems in the Channel tunnel. When I arrived at Gare du Nord, the Eurostar area was closed off and very little information available. After 10 or 15 minutes, a woman came out and told us there were no more trains that day and they had no ability to help us at the station. She asked us to leave the station and use the website to rebook.Eurostar offered no assistance finding a hotel. The rebooking processing via the website took over 2 hours to come back with a new booking via email. I tried to ring Eurostar but they would not reply.Eventually I was rebooked on a train the next morning. When I arrived at Gare du Nord, there were huge queues and nobody providing information. It was not clear how to get my new ticket. The queues were so long they had to postpone the train's departure. Eventually, after much hassle I got back to London.I was surprised that Eurostar had such a hard time dealing with disruptions on the line. These happen fairly often. I have experienced disruptions on airlines and they help finding hotels and getting meals. Eurostar offered no help at all.I'm now trying to claim back my expenses and compensation. This is also proving very difficult.The whole experience has been characterized by extremely poor customer service by Eurostar. I will avoid them in the future.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	Will use alternative ways of getting to France in future	I have sent three complaints to this company. Not one response.The staff are surly arrogant and unhelpful. Plenty of staff stood around telling people what to do, but only one person actually doing anything. Greedy business, delighted to see lots of empty seats on our return crossing.Our complaint relates to being on time to board the train, but because we had been delayed following a major incident on the metro we were not allowed to join the queue, although others were still going through. We had to pay 80 euros to travel an hour later on a train with many free seats. That train was late arriving, which caused us to just miss our next train. Result £160 extra just because of some patronising jobsworth who didn't like English people - no doubt fuelled by Brexit sadly.Since discovered it would have been easier and cheaper to fly to our destination near Limoges which is what I am doing next week. My loss is definitely Eurostar's loss now.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	Not what we paid for	I travelled today with my daughter on the 18.04 out of St Pancras to Brussels.  The trip was arranged for my birthday present and my first experience of Eurostar. We were seated in coach 008 seats 43 and 44. My daughter paid for a meal and a standard premier seat.  The train operatives commenced serving food.  They stopped at the seat in from of us.  The operative apologised and said he was off to replenish his trolley. Unfortunately when his trolley was replenished he commenced serving from the rear of our carriage and ran out AGAIN when he reached us.   I would also point out that we appeared to be the only 2 people travelling together.  He apologised profusely and he and a female colleague went in search of our meal. Sadly to no avail.  We were then offered something from the on board cafe. We went to look at the menu and we're disappointed to see bread, bread, bread, wraps and again bread !!!!! Exactly what we wanted to avoid.  Full marks to the operative he tried to reassure us that the food from the cafe cost Eurostar much more than the salmon we might have had. He did try to lighten the load but bottles of wine where not what we wanted or expected. Eurostar you need to up your game. Potential travellers be aware you could pay £100'for toasted sandwiches for 2 and wine.  Happy Birthday NOT.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	Do Not Do Business with this Company	"Eurostar is dishonest. They will rip you off.  You will pay for a ticket, then find out that eurostar charged you a grossly higher price.  When I went back, after this discovery, on the subway, I literally got off the train, and took the subway back moments later, the same day.The manager, and 2 other staff were extremely condescending, and rude. They have no concern for the customer or any of their erroneous activity. They refused to correct this error, they also refused my request for a refund. I complained to their ""travel care"" Dept. to no avail."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	Old cramped expensive trains	"Eurostar is incredibly expensive for what are horrible trains. I'm 6'6"" and I do not fit in the seats, I cannot get my legs in, they are either wedged on the seat back or I have to sit sideways with my legs in the aisle. If I sit at a table and there is someone opposite my legs go nearly to the opposite seat so they best get used to my knee in their crutch. French TGV trains are newer and far better. Eurostar seats are threadbare, ripped and the entire train should be scrapped."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	Scoundrels! £135 to get on a LATER train!!!!	So I'm going to France in a few days. I wanted to change my 7:55am train to a 9:17am train as I've found out that I won't be able to check into my accommodation till 4pm in Fontainebleau. So I tried to change tickets online and I was quoted £135 - oh and there is a credit card fee. If you try to call them to change tickets it's a £10 fee + credit card fee + £135. What a disgusting exchange policy. Even worse than easyjet and Ryanair! Next time I'm taking the ferry. Eurostar have lost my faith and custom. It is unjustifiable to charge so much to change tickets. £10 okay, but £135?!?! Does Eurostar think money grows on trees?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	Day light robbery	I bought tickets for me and my daughter to Brussels, but I can't go due to recovering from the surgery (post ticket booking and unforeseeable). They will not refund but offered me a change of date!! Great I thought take my daughter away for a couple of days at Xmas as our summer holidays have had to be cancelled!!  After changing the dates, they then asked me to pay £149 in admin charges to change the tickets!!Oh and the £149 admin should have been £169 but they waived two £10 fees and it doesn't include the difference in fares!! Considering the original tickets cost £171.50!?!  A joke of an organisation, will not book any travel with Eurostar in the future  and would discourage others from doing so too!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	bet on your arrival times. scamming refunds	I traveled 4 or 5 times this year with eurostar. Many times had huge delays that are refunded partly and only in case of extreme delays. Don't get attracted by the easy access to the train station. Your still have to arrive 1 and half hour before in order to do a checkin.Coaches are old and without electric plugs.Tickets are expensive and overpriced if you book one week before travel.This is the last time I will use this service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	Over hyped and pathetic customer service	I travelled from London to Brussels and the service was horrible in Standard Premier with rude on board staff. Not to mention the mismanaged boarding procedures at St. Pancras where the train arrives on the platform just 5 mins before departure.  Next time I will take a plane or try the Dutch Flyer service instead. Definitely avoid this option.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	i got scammed by Eurostar	"Eurostar make you pay hidden fees such as a 40euros ""late arrival fees"" if you arrive less than 30min in advance. They are losing money and try to make up for it by stealing from their own customers."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	Poor Performance!!!	I have used your Eurostar service from London to Paris on Friday July 8th at 14:01. This service was heavily delayed by one hour. This caused me a lot of problems and in the end was unable to enjoy my trip due to the lateness of my arrival.The staff on this service did not keep to the promised times that the service was to arrive and kept changing this throughout the journey. The last announcement was that the service was going to arrive at 17:40, it in fact arrived just before 18:00.The train was also dirty and the toilets disgusting! The staff on the buffet were very unhelpful and not at all interested. The staff told me to speak with the train manager who was nowhere to be seen throughout the journey, he simply hid away somewhere on the train!!On my departure from Paris to London on Sunday July 10th at 19:01 the service was yet again delayed. I had become unwell at this point with stress, worry & extremely frustrated. I feel that the service in the station were not helpful and inefficient.When I boarded this service people were allowed to sit with Standard Premier class passenger’s who had standard tickets. This I feel was unprofessional and does not make any of the people in this coach feel the value of the ticket. These people were very noisy causing disturbance & people were unhappy. I booked this ticket so I could avoid such noise. My friend travelled with me as I was not well. She was helping me at my seat and when the food finally came to my table I had asked my friend to try it for me as I cannot eat certain foods. The train manager was very rude to us and was not at all helpful. When I used the toilet the cabinet between the coaches with the controls inside was left open and was dangerous and I nearly hit my head on it. There are witnesses to this should you wish to investigate this.The wi-fi was also not working in my coach so I was unable to communicate with family to let them know that I was being delayed again. The service in the buffet car was totally unacceptable and my friend had to wait half an hour to be served.In my five years of travelling with Eurostar I feel this will now have to be my last Eurostar journey as a result of all the upset & illness you have caused me.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	This company is simply unable to handle any disruption!!	On the 30th of May. I was left stranded in Paris at 10.45pm by the cancellation of my eurostar scheduled at 9.01pm  after 3.5 hours queuing in total chaos.Staff was nowhere to be seen the whole evening  to manage the impressive crowd or give any info for that matter! (screen where showing 1 hour delay for each train the whole evening!)Some customers apparently had info about train cancellation around 9.30 pm however they let us queue for nothing during another 1hour 15 before they made any announcement!They were so many people looking for an hotel around the station I had to take the tube to get to gare de l'est and then book a flight and a taxi to return home the next morningI have taken eurostar many times over the years (I am french and been expatriate in London for the last 12 years) and yes when everything goes well this is a great experience, unfortunately they are just unable to manage disruption and with all the various problem looming around (terror threat , illegal migrants ,etc...) disruption are all the more likely!I WILL NOT CHANCE IT AGAIN!I am currently in the process of asking for refund and might have to write another review about customer service!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	Easy to book, but limited options via app. Excellent journey!	I haven't used Eurostar yet but the ease of booking is incredibly easy. I booked my trip to Paris via the Eurostar app and it was booked within a minute, however - you can only book a train from London in the UK, I don't live in London so I had to book another train ticket separately or go onto the desktop website to book it from Birmingham (which to me - seems counterproductive as what's the point in having the app?) so on a whole, the UX on the app is good if you're living in London but anywhere else in the UK? Not so much...EDIT: I forgot to review my journey with Eurostar. Absolutely incredible! I started my journey in Birmingham New Street to London Euston then a quick switch from Euston to St Pancras International. What a beautiful train station! I absolutely loved the check in barriers, where you can scan your mobile boarding pass too! Security was fast, went from check in, through body scanners, and through border control in less than 3 minutes! No need to take your shoes or jacket off, either! The departure lounge had a plethora of seating and was spacious. We boarded around 20 minutes before departure. I traveled on the new E320, I thoroughly enjoyed the new train, very spacious and clean. We left bang on time. I love the in train entertainment and the on board bar! I arrived in Gare du Nord a few minutes late but it didn't really matter. The return journey was just as great, I would wholeheartedly recommend using Eurostar. I paid £77 from Birmingham to Paris, which was much cheaper than flying and is much, much better! Look forward to use again, Eurostar!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	Using the Recent Tragic Events in Brussels for Commercial Gain	Beware this is not an honest company!Travelling from Brussels to London in the recent difficult situation I was initially impressed and reassured by the tighter security controls. I was told that I was not allowed to take my penknife (blade <75mm) onto the train, although the Eurostar website showed that I could.  This was not a problem to me and understandable in the circumstances. However I was not expecting to be surcharged to use Eurostar's own commercial service to transport my knife to London. Providing misinformation on their website to allow them to commercially exploit  customers in the current tragic situation in Brussels is a shameful and despicable act. The surcharge of €20 is out of all proportion to effort involved in securely transporting the item. Accurate information on the website would allow passengers to decide whether or not to take a penknife of not before setting out.Given the clear lack of travellers (only 4 people in my coach), Eurostar should be supporting and welcoming those still travelling with them.I have written to Eurostar on the matter but they have not deemed me worthy of a response.I	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	Don't like the new trains	I have traveled back from France a few weeks ago.. and it was a new train which I thought cool it is going to be more comfortable.. but apart the nicer look and more space for my long legs.. It is not comfortable at all.. I miss the heat things on the side that really help you to sleep in peace, the seats are hard and to be honest I prefer the older ones.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	3
2016-11-22T09:46:36Z	Appalling	"Useless, arrogant, rude, aggressive staff with a sense of ""entitlement"" - not that you (or I), the customer, would be entitled to anything, just to follow orders. They don't even deserve the 1 star I am forced to give them.The best you'll get is in Standard class, where you don't see any staff, just sometimes one of them walking past with a look on their face that says ""I'm busy, don't you dare bother me!"". That's the absolute best you'll ever get. Don't even think of paying a premium. As you upgrade, the don't-bother-me staff becomes a crossbreed between ticket inspectors and door bouncers. And don't expect any extra service for your money - there is none. Having presented my ticket a first time at the check-in turnstiles, I arrived at the door of my ""Standard Premier"" carriage with one piece of luggage in each hand and a heavy rucksack on my back (within the baggage limits). I was greeted by a demand to see my ticket a second time. I wouldn't even have dreamt of a little help with my luggage, this would have been a five-star service, and who says that you should expect any extra service if you pay a premium? No, I simply asked if I could drop my luggage in the racks in the carriage first, prior to showing her my ticket. ""No, it's the rule, and it's applicable to everyone"". And the row escalated, and escalated... e.g. the same female ""door bouncer"" later coming to see me in my seat with her boss demanding an apology! If I had paid for a standard ticket, at least nobody would have bothered me, I could have dropped my luggage and settled in my seat without fuss. I paid a premium, and I was treated as if I were a liar and a cheater - because of course, if I present myself at a ""Standard Premium"" carriage door, and if I don't show my ticket instantly, it must be that I am trying to access a carriage that is not mine. In a way, I was treated even worse than if I hadn't paid the price premium.I will not be treated like this by the very people whom I am contributing to pay. Airlines (none of them) don't treat you that way. Actually, one of them, which was East Midlands based, used to employ staff with the same sense of entitlement, greater than your rights as a customer. They are now defunct. On the return leg of my Eurostar journey, there were at least 8 empty seats in my carriage. In future, there will be a ninth empty seat, and I can't wait for the day when Eurostar goes bust and all these Eurostar people can claim the last of their ""entitlement"", i.e. JSA - or when at least HS1 and the equivalent high-speed railtracks on the continent side will be really open to competition, with another train operator being allowed to operate a service on the same line. Until such a time, I'm afraid they will continue to feel ""entitled"". In the meantime, one thing they are not entitled to is my custom; Eurostar have lost my custom for the rest of my life. They will never ever get one more penny of my money. It may take maybe an extra 30 minutes door-to-door, but flying is cheaper and you get some customer service."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-01-19T13:25:19Z	Terrible UX	Awful UX. Shocking for such s big company. The website needs a complete overhaul. Payment system failed six times so I had to call up to book my seats by which time the price has gone up. A horrible experience.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-01-19T13:25:19Z	1st Class Ticket 3rd class Experience	I'd sooner crawl to Paris on my hands and knees that use the 'fake' first class on Eurostar. Arrived Gare Du Nord only to find we were NOT  entitled to use the first class lounge and had to battle it out in the main  and very overcrowded area where no seats were available.Directed to the wrong seats by crew eventually after find our own seats I thought Id read one of the 'complementary ' newspapers only to be set upon  by a rabid aggressive female crew member telling me that the papers were for FULL FIRST CLASS fare paying passenger's only. A while later she came into our humble fist class carriage( in name only) stating all the papers were not wanted I could have one  if I wanted. I said I no longer wanted it at which point she began to loudly berate us in front if passenger's telling us we had 'only paid' for standard premier not full first class and we're not entitled to a complimentary newspaper.She then departed locking the compartment door open do as to cause a draft, glared at us every time she stormed through the carriage. A cold  (no warm choice) supper was served complete with a cracked dirty glass and lipstick smear.No champagne in our compartment even though on the phone I was told there would be one complimentary glass.After complaining to Eurostar as this was a birthday surprise and the day was ruined, they were completely indifferent and basically did not care that have an unhinged person working for them on their trains.My advice if you must go Eurostar DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY UPGRADING as you get nothing for it. Staff don't treat you as a first class passenger and clearly see you as an annoyance. Next time I shall FLY where the airlines  VALUE their  customers and take complaints seriously.

2016-01-19T13:25:19Z	Outragerous high fee!	I found out that i have ordered tickets from Paris to London on the wrong date. The tickets are nunrefundable because it is the standard ones. But to change the date, i have to pay 30£ pr person! That is outragerous! I even found out only a few hours after i paid, and there's nothing i can do about it.

2016-01-19T13:25:19Z	Jobsworth Staff, No Offer of Negotiation	we didn't travel to Paris on the Eurostar on 14/11 after the tragic events of 13/11.  Expedia negotiated us a refund on our hotel, the Trainline.com immediately refunded our return tickets to St Pancras, and the concert organisers who cancelled the event that was to have taken plwf4 on 16/11 have all already given refunds, but not Eurostar.  they can only suggest we rebook for free - to go somewhere we now have no need to visit or transfer somewhere else we haven't a need to go.  Very poor under the circumstances.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2016-01-19T13:25:19Z	For the price paid: services = zero	I used to take eurostar trains on regular intervals between London and Brussels, but since I moved to Manchester I found it much more convenient to fly there instead. There was simply no service, tight seating and smelly trains and No Wifi. Had it not been for the necessity I'd have surely chosen other means of transport.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	2
2016-01-19T13:25:19Z	Unhelpful staff	Travelled with Eurostar in August 20015- Entered the main reception i'm disabled walk with a stick, it's clearly visible.Approached staff told trains were just inside the glass partition,so did not request wheelchair as it was just inside partition.Well, it turned out, it was quite a walk to the waiting train. Every so many meter's there was a ramp to board the train i asked a staff member if i could board the train using the ramp, i was told NO just no -  no further conversation! Walked on to the next ramp, able bodied family of six boarded the train using the ramp staff member standing next to the ramp did not say a word . My husband asked if i could use the ramp showing the scan with the screw's holding my ankle together and again told no.By now clearly distressed walked to the next ramp told the same. No alternative but to use the step to board the train where i promptly fell on to my knee's.Lucky i was not hurt but, this could have ruined my holiday.Clearly the disabled are not welcome at Eurostar.Staff don't care.!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-01-19T13:25:19Z	Only insults and sarcasm from staff	"Accidents can happen anywhere, but the deplorable behaviour of two Eurostar staff members only prolonged my pain. I learned that if anything happens at all on the Eurostar, you are left to your own device with no help from staff except unprofessionalism, contempt, mockery and sarcasm. As I was resting in my seat, a woman tripped as she walked down the aisle and she hit my face as she fell. I realised it was bad after a few minutes when it started to swell and I had to wipe off blood dripping down my face. I asked the train manager for help in French and English, but he said there was nothing he or Eurostar could do as they are ""neither doctors nor the police"". He said they were not allowed to have first aid kits on board for ""legal reasons"". Later, the train manager claimed he didn't understand I wanted medical care (don't ask me what he thought I wanted pointing at my bleeding face!). “He probably didn’t understand your French” his colleague said. This comment is utterly offensive in any circumstance on a “trilingual” Eurostar service. It was especially offensive in this case as his colleague chose to insult and humiliate an injured customer instead of showing professionalism (let alone showing basic human empathy). On arrival in London, the same staff repeated that “it was my fault for not asking for a doctor”, and when I asked for medical care on the station, the same rude staff member was extremely inappropriate again: “Oh poor you. Are you sure you don’t want me to call for a wheelchair too?. She continuously scorned and verbally abused me as a passenger, using insult and humiliation while I was injured and bleeding from my face. I asked if at least they will could write some report about the accident, noting down what happened and the people involved. He then answered ""This is not our problem. It has nothing to do with us. It is between you and the woman who fell. You can ask for her name yourself. It was only an accident anyway"". I replied that I have never seen the woman who fell, I have no idea where she sits and do not want walk around looking for somebody while my face is bleeding. “You should have pulled the red handle if you needed helped after the accident” they said. I understood the red handle was only to be used for imminent dangers, so that is why I had looked for staff who were unhelpful in the end."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-01-19T13:25:19Z	Incidents all the time, customer service inacceptable	I was victim of the Eurostar incident on 23 June 2015 and got stuck in London. Eurostar was unable to confirm when we could get back to Paris, so I decided to get home by airplane. On the next day I was told by one of the customer service employees that I could get a compensation for the extra travel and meal costs (150£ for hotel and 50£ for meals), so I sent them all documents and requested the refund. 2 weeks later I was told that I wasn't entitled to a compensation as I decided to get back to Paris by airplane and not by Eurostar. I found this treatment inacceptable as they were lying to me when I first contacted them. it was a very painful experience to get stuck first a good 1/2 hour in the tunnel without any information from them regarding the incident and then in London without any compensation.  I am sure I will not take the Eurostar again although I am travelling 5-6 times to London per year for work. My choice is now Air France.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-01-19T13:25:19Z	Poor experience due to insufficient legroom	We took the Eurostar in the beginning of June 2015. Well the legroom is insufficient. Its that simple. We took the secondclass, this was the only affordable ticket available. Okay its only a 2 hour ride, but still. The legroom in Dutch trains (and german ones) is much better. You would expect them to be able to design a train with sufficient space to sit. We are cured and will take the airplane to London next time. Never will I travel Eurostar again. That is not until they bring legroom up from their French low level up to German and or Dutch superior level.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	2
2016-01-19T13:25:19Z	Worse customer care ever.	I was very disappointed with Eurostar. As a loyal customer I was expected a compensation for a delay that occurred few weeks ago. Apparently they do not give compensation for delay of 59 min. If they were late 1h exactly I will have receive a compensation. For 1 min they actually refused. They said delays are rare which is not true. SERIOUSLY REFUSING COMPENSATION FOR 1 MIN. THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS. Worse customer care ever.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-01-19T13:25:19Z	Quick, Clean, Simple – What’s not to like?	I used Euro Star for a weekend break to Paris 3 weeks ago and it was bliss. None of the usual stress associated with the airport. You board in the centre of London and are hurried through to the centre of Paris in just a couple of hours. There may not be as much to do whilst waiting as you get at the airports, but then I normally end up buying something and then getting stung for extra luggage charges on the way back! The train is quick, spacious and relatively quiet (Ok – there were a few excited kids en-route to Paris before EuroDisney, but not much EuroStar can do about that!). Gare de Nord (although I had heard horror stories) was great, no worse than London stations, and the staff who were rumoured to be unhelpful couldn’t have been nicer. All-in-all – Great!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	5

2016-01-19T13:25:19Z	Hopeless!	Eurostar must have the most hopeless website on the net. Try searching on google for Bruges and you end up with Eurostar £79 tickets but..to nowhere. You'll go round and round in circles but you will never find the £79 ticket. You'll be lucky to find Bruges unless it's on an expensive short break. Time waster companies like this should be banned from the net as they simply waste people's time and harass customers by their rubbish websites. I am extremely angry having wasted my time on this site. The only way to get to Bruges is probably to go to a Eurostar station to get the information...assuming the desk is open that is which at Ashford it very rarely is. I would suggest this company sack their useless IT team who clearly have no idea how to design a website for customers and get some qualified IT people to sort it out. For a guide to this please visit National Rail Enquiries. Its straightforward no messing about website and is obviously designed by people with good customer focus and IT skills.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2016-01-19T13:25:19Z	Service in need...	"My review is specifically meant to help travellers using Eurorail/Interrail passes.The possibility of using the Eurostar trains when travelling between France/Belgium and the UK is a promissing alternative to flying. The regular tickets are quite expensive compared to flights from basically anywhere in Europe but in coordination with the Globalpass travellers get a slight discount.The actual method of travelling is recommendable since it is fairly easy to board, the seats are of similar quality to discount flights and you travel from the centre of Paris to the centre of London.Globalpass holders must be aware of some difficulties when it comes to booking. If you really make an effort and look for it both the Eurorail and the Eurostar websites explains that booking can only be done at the booking offices and per telephone. Booking should be done a couple of weeks in advance, so you need to fly to either Paris or London before planning to visit the places a couple of weeks later in order to book your tickets. That of course is ridiculous why I called their booking office - waited for what seemed like forever until my credits were used up spending 20 euros and without tickets.Afterwards I book the seats online, pay the full price for the cheapest tickets I could find and hope for some understanding due to mitigating circumstances.I go to the sales office at the trainstation in an attempt to solve the problem but they did not know how. In their defence the young girl was very polite and understanding but she could only give me a card of a person I should contact.I have now received the 3rd email from Eurostars customer care telling me that Eurostar has no interest in helping me and that Eurorail should have helped me better. No matter the circumstances they refuse to even acknowledge the problem and have yet to even ask to see my Europass.  A very simple matter made very complicated. I was entitled to a reduced price but being on eurorail through out Europe I was unable to ""follow the conditions"" of the exact same special Eurorail ticket.So far they have successfully hid behind their conditions which is their right. I could just have flown to Paris, ordered the tickets and flown back to where ever I was at the time. That seems reasonable.I am just asking: ""Why pay extra for bad service?""Eurostar - Bad service and condecending traveller care will haunt those who do not make an effort.All in all: If your are Eurorailing in Europe having the time of your life - Book a flight if you need to cross the Channel."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	They refuse to give any refunds for Covid-19	They refuse to give any refunds for trips canceled because of Government restrictions on travel due to Covid-19.  We tried to re-book 3 times and each time the governments of both France and the UK have banned us from traveling in and out of their countries and yet Eurostar continues to keep our money!  EVERY other airline and train company has given us our money back.  Eurostar STILL refuses!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	I had the worst eurostar experience…	I had the worst eurostar experience yesterday 23 October 2020, afternoon train. It is been few weeks/months that eurostar is struggling with covid, constantly cancelling bookings. Those cancellated booking are free of charge replacement. But those ticket always disappear from the eurostar app. So it is difficult to track ticket whose has been cancelled. So you always have to go back to your booking emails, if you still have them. It is OK if you one ticket cancelled but when you have 10 return tickets it is really painful and not clear. In addition, you cannot change them on the app as from time to time it does not work. So as I could not change my ticket I went to eurostar yesterday beforr departure as i have done it several times before, I asked someone to change my ticket to the next departure. But, when I arrived they had no one from eurostar able to change my cancelled tickets due to a reduction of staf in the station. But had 3 people there to say 'hi' to people!? Find the error !The staf there was berly speaking French. Feel really offended that the line manager present there expected me to speak with me in  flamish to explain the current issue.  Feel a bit of racism! She did not want to help me at all.Later on, an other lady arrived, a bit late 15minutes before departure. She was almost having an heart attack when the eurostar line manager told her she cannot get in. The line manage and her colleague have not moved a fingers in order to help this poor lady while having an shorten breath. She would have let her die. It is unbelievable how eurostar is dealing with covid issue. It is the worst experience I have ever had. How people can be that unrespectful?Eurostar should review they staf and find helpful staf, willing to help passengers in this diffucult time and not make the passanger life even more diffucult. Next time I will travel by flight.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Thieves	I was notified less that 24 hours before my departure that my return ticket was cancelled. With both reduced Eurostar service and current Sncf Covid schedules there is just no trains that connects on time anymore for my journey back. That meant that if I were to take the inbound journey I would end up stranded in France. The only option I had left with was to change my journey from Strasbourg-London via Lille instead of Paris. Eurostar refused to change this leg of the journey for me despite the inconvenience they caused. They told me the only option I had was to get the voucher and rebook the entire journey back. But the entire journey back including changing the Sncf trains last minute would have cost us 2.5x the price of our original tickets. No compensation, no help, just a stressful two hours on the phone arguing with them to end up with nothing. Holidays cancelled. Oh and yes now I need to wait 28 days to be able to use up my voucher. Thieves.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	They will not refund my money	"They will not refund my money.  THey claim they have sent a refund, but my bank tells me such a ""refund"" has not reached them after 6 months.  Maybe they sent it ""Burro Express"", but it is starting to look more and more like they just want to keep my money and keep on making excuses."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Your website is such a bad experience	"Your website is such a bad experience! Your customer service is hard to reach. Problem 1 - back in June I was coming back from France to the UK and my tickets were canceled and your website wouldn't let me change my ticket so I had to buy a new one. I sent you an email asking for a refund and I still didn't get a reply. Can someone reply to me and pay me back for this please it has been months. Problem 2: I have a trip to the UK next week and my train both ways was canceled, I was told to change my train free of charge but when I go to manage my booking all the options are paid. I am being asked to pay £105 for changing my trains. I now tried several times to log in and log out from my account, once I saw the options to be free (which is how it should be) so I selected the options and pressed a button to change my ticket, but guess what the Eurostar website decided to crash. It's saying ""we are almost there"" for the past 15 minutes. So as a result I still did not manage to change my tickets. I am posting here and on Twitter in a hope to get a response."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Update - Gift voucher refusal to extend expiry date	I was initially very disappointed to find that eurostar were not prepared to extend the expiry date on vouchers bought as a gift. The person had not been able to use them due to the covid situation as they are in the vulnerable category. Their initial response was to say all vouchers are only valid for 12 months. However after I emailed expressing my disappointment and also posted a negative review on here they replied promptly. They apologised for the first email and have now extended the vouchers until Sept next year.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Horrible & Stressful Journey, I’ll never EuroStar again!	Horrible customer service, rude train staff and uncomfortable journey. They cancelled and rebooked our journey multiple times, costing us hundreds of pounds, saying we had to pay again for each rebooking. In the end, the trains they booked were so messed up that we arrived from Amsterdam to Brussels AFTER our train from Brussels to London left. Thus, missing our ride back home. We spent so much extra money trying to get back to the UK. And, although I deeply support and understand the current COVID19 sensitivity and the required guidelines, I suffer from severe eczema on my face, which makes me medically exempt from face masks. I still do my best to put up with the pain and wear a face mask for as many hours as I can.  Wearing one for a prolonged amount of time causes bleeding and a lot of pain. After the first 2 hours of the journey, my skin needed a break, but when I informed the attendants, they told me unless I had a medical report from a hospital, I wasn’t allowed to take it off. UK laws strictly prohibit anyone from asking for a medical report to prove you are exempt from face masks due to a medical disability, which can be seen on the government website. However, Eurostar is clearly exempt from government guidelines. I felt really embarrassed trying to explain my health condition, which feels so private, and the UK guidelines to an attendant while the whole carriage listened.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Eurotrash!	Had tickets booked from Paris to London. Five days before we were due to travel, we got a message saying our train had been cancelled, but we would be issued with a voucher, which we could offset against future travel.If a service provider fails to provided the service which has been contractually agreed, without offering a valid reason, then they are in breach of contract. Eurostar's reson was 'Covid-19 restrictions'. At the time, the restrictions were no different to when we made our outward journey so this was nonsense. In any case, if they don't provide the service, they are legally obliged to make a full refund.Anyway, to continue. Although our train was cancelled, they had another one available, for which we could book tickets at almost 4 X the cost of the original ones. You might ask why they didn't simply offer us travel on that train using our original tickets, if seats were available. We wondered that too and emailed Eurostar, but three days later, there is still no reply.Effectively, Eurostar abandoned its customers in a foreign country and offered not a jot of support, simply asking for more money. Bearing in mind the current situation, I would put this on the same level as profiteering in wartime. Their behaviour is absolutely despicable.Despite the inconvenience and added time, I will be driving to Europe in future, rather than travelling with this bunch of crooks	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Lost A Loyal Customer	I've staying in travelled many times with Eurostar, and was generally happy with them, so was expecting a reasonable approach during the Covid times. However, their policies have left me significantly out of pocket so I won't be travelling with them again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

And still no reduction, despite this, in fares	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Eurostar trying to profit from quarantines	In the middle of recently announced quarantines, Eurostar has removed its free exchange option, in that a fee applies for any change within 14 days. I just tried to change my ticket for one where the change fee was minimal. I had to update my payment details first. Within a few minutes, all change options are now £75! Being held over a barrel, shocking behaviour	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Taking advantage of Covid to rip off customers	No answer from customer service Didn't appreciate they have used Covid-19 and travel restrictions to increase their prices and force people to pay double to travel back. Also never book another train ticket on Eurostar. They offer the bookings but won't take responsibility if the train is late and you miss your connection ( and they don't plan enough time between connections).	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Voucher arrived promptly	I asked for a voucher because I had to cancel my second attempt at going to Amsterdam because of Covid. The voucher was issued the same day.

No support, no help, cant change destination (which may have helped with date change), dates for next year unavaliable.Legitimate scam.

2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Thieves	I was notified less that 24 hours before my departure that my return ticket was cancelled. With both reduced Eurostar service and current Sncf Covid schedules there is just no trains that connects on time anymore for my journey back. That meant that if I were to take the inbound journey I would end up stranded in France. The only option I had left with was to change my journey from Strasbourg-London via Lille instead of Paris. Eurostar refused to change this leg of the journey for me despite the inconvenience they caused. They told me the only option I had was to get the voucher and rebook the entire journey back. But the entire journey back including changing the Sncf trains last minute would have cost us 2.5x the price of our original tickets. No compensation, no help, just a stressful two hours on the phone arguing with them to end up with nothing. Holidays cancelled. Oh and yes now I need to wait 28 days to be able to use up my voucher. Thieves.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	They will not refund my money	"They will not refund my money.  THey claim they have sent a refund, but my bank tells me such a ""refund"" has not reached them after 6 months.  Maybe they sent it ""Burro Express"", but it is starting to look more and more like they just want to keep my money and keep on making excuses."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Your website is such a bad experience	"Your website is such a bad experience! Your customer service is hard to reach. Problem 1 - back in June I was coming back from France to the UK and my tickets were canceled and your website wouldn't let me change my ticket so I had to buy a new one. I sent you an email asking for a refund and I still didn't get a reply. Can someone reply to me and pay me back for this please it has been months. Problem 2: I have a trip to the UK next week and my train both ways was canceled, I was told to change my train free of charge but when I go to manage my booking all the options are paid. I am being asked to pay £105 for changing my trains. I now tried several times to log in and log out from my account, once I saw the options to be free (which is how it should be) so I selected the options and pressed a button to change my ticket, but guess what the Eurostar website decided to crash. It's saying ""we are almost there"" for the past 15 minutes. So as a result I still did not manage to change my tickets. I am posting here and on Twitter in a hope to get a response."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Update - Gift voucher refusal to extend expiry date	I was initially very disappointed to find that eurostar were not prepared to extend the expiry date on vouchers bought as a gift. The person had not been able to use them due to the covid situation as they are in the vulnerable category. Their initial response was to say all vouchers are only valid for 12 months. However after I emailed expressing my disappointment and also posted a negative review on here they replied promptly. They apologised for the first email and have now extended the vouchers until Sept next year.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Horrible & Stressful Journey, I’ll never EuroStar again!	Horrible customer service, rude train staff and uncomfortable journey. They cancelled and rebooked our journey multiple times, costing us hundreds of pounds, saying we had to pay again for each rebooking. In the end, the trains they booked were so messed up that we arrived from Amsterdam to Brussels AFTER our train from Brussels to London left. Thus, missing our ride back home. We spent so much extra money trying to get back to the UK. And, although I deeply support and understand the current COVID19 sensitivity and the required guidelines, I suffer from severe eczema on my face, which makes me medically exempt from face masks. I still do my best to put up with the pain and wear a face mask for as many hours as I can.  Wearing one for a prolonged amount of time causes bleeding and a lot of pain. After the first 2 hours of the journey, my skin needed a break, but when I informed the attendants, they told me unless I had a medical report from a hospital, I wasn’t allowed to take it off. UK laws strictly prohibit anyone from asking for a medical report to prove you are exempt from face masks due to a medical disability, which can be seen on the government website. However, Eurostar is clearly exempt from government guidelines. I felt really embarrassed trying to explain my health condition, which feels so private, and the UK guidelines to an attendant while the whole carriage listened.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Eurotrash!	Had tickets booked from Paris to London. Five days before we were due to travel, we got a message saying our train had been cancelled, but we would be issued with a voucher, which we could offset against future travel.If a service provider fails to provided the service which has been contractually agreed, without offering a valid reason, then they are in breach of contract. Eurostar's reson was 'Covid-19 restrictions'. At the time, the restrictions were no different to when we made our outward journey so this was nonsense. In any case, if they don't provide the service, they are legally obliged to make a full refund.Anyway, to continue. Although our train was cancelled, they had another one available, for which we could book tickets at almost 4 X the cost of the original ones. You might ask why they didn't simply offer us travel on that train using our original tickets, if seats were available. We wondered that too and emailed Eurostar, but three days later, there is still no reply.Effectively, Eurostar abandoned its customers in a foreign country and offered not a jot of support, simply asking for more money. Bearing in mind the current situation, I would put this on the same level as profiteering in wartime. Their behaviour is absolutely despicable.Despite the inconvenience and added time, I will be driving to Europe in future, rather than travelling with this bunch of crooks	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Lost A Loyal Customer	I've staying in travelled many times with Eurostar, and was generally happy with them, so was expecting a reasonable approach during the Covid times. However, their policies have left me significantly out of pocket so I won't be travelling with them again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Fares remain unspeakably high, shops mainly closed at Gar Du Nord (although other shops seem to be able to open), whilst it seems possible on French railways to buy food, this seems to her beyond possible for Eurostar. And still no reduction, despite this, in fares	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Eurostar trying to profit from quarantines	In the middle of recently announced quarantines, Eurostar has removed its free exchange option, in that a fee applies for any change within 14 days. I just tried to change my ticket for one where the change fee was minimal. I had to update my payment details first. Within a few minutes, all change options are now £75! Being held over a barrel, shocking behaviour	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Taking advantage of Covid to rip off customers	No answer from customer service Didn't appreciate they have used Covid-19 and travel restrictions to increase their prices and force people to pay double to travel back. Also never book another train ticket on Eurostar. They offer the bookings but won't take responsibility if the train is late and you miss your connection ( and they don't plan enough time between connections).	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Voucher arrived promptly	I asked for a voucher because I had to cancel my second attempt at going to Amsterdam because of Covid. The voucher was issued the same day. I just hope that I'm not going to have to pay more when I rebook for May 2021!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Unfortunately it seems Eurostar are an awful company.	Horrible company it turns out.

Got an evoucher and rebooked, now they want money to change it as it falls outside their arbritrary dates. No support, no help, cant change destination (which may have helped with date change), dates for next year unavaliable.Legitimate scam. I would expect this from a dodgy chinese advertised on Facebook, not a company like this.Unfortunately, good intentions of being green should remain just that.

2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Over 4 months a still no refund	Like many others we have been trying for over four months to claim a refund for a cancelled train. They try to fob you off with a voucher despite the fact they are legally obliged to give refunds. Despite repeated emails we have just received one holding reply over three months ago. All the other train companies we booked for our holiday have sent prompt refunds. There is no excuse for this appalling lack of service. It seems they are trying to minimise the number of refunds paid.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	They refuse to give any refunds for Covid-19	They refuse to give any refunds for trips canceled because of Government restrictions on travel due to Covid-19.  We tried to re-book 3 times and each time the governments of both France and the UK have banned us from traveling in and out of their countries and yet Eurostar continues to keep our money!

2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	I had the worst eurostar experience…	I had the worst eurostar experience yesterday 23 October 2020, afternoon train. It is been few weeks/months that eurostar is struggling with covid, constantly cancelling bookings. Those cancellated booking are free of charge replacement. But those ticket always disappear from the eurostar app. So it is difficult to track ticket whose has been cancelled. So you always have to go back to your booking emails, if you still have them. It is OK if you one ticket cancelled but when you have 10 return tickets it is really painful and not clear. In addition, you cannot change them on the app as from time to time it does not work. So as I could not change my ticket I went to eurostar yesterday beforr departure as i have done it several times before, I asked someone to change my ticket to the next departure. But, when I arrived they had no one from eurostar able to change my cancelled tickets due to a reduction of staf in the station. But had 3 people there to say 'hi' to people!? Find the error !The staf there was berly speaking French. Feel really offended that the line manager present there expected me to speak with me in  flamish to explain the current issue.  Feel a bit of racism! She did not want to help me at all.Later on, an other lady arrived, a bit late 15minutes before departure. She was almost having an heart attack when the eurostar line manager told her she cannot get in. The line manage and her colleague have not moved a fingers in order to help this poor lady while having an shorten breath. She would have let her die. It is unbelievable how eurostar is dealing with covid issue. It is the worst experience I have ever had. How people can be that unrespectful?Eurostar should review they staf and find helpful staf, willing to help passengers in this diffucult time and not make the passanger life even more diffucult.

However after I emailed expressing my disappointment and also posted a negative review on here they replied promptly. They apologised for the first email and have now extended the vouchers until Sept next year.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Horrible & Stressful Journey, I’ll never EuroStar again!	Horrible customer service, rude train staff and uncomfortable journey. They cancelled and rebooked our journey multiple times, costing us hundreds of pounds, saying we had to pay again for each rebooking. In the end, the trains they booked were so messed up that we arrived from Amsterdam to Brussels AFTER our train from Brussels to London left. Thus, missing our ride back home. We spent so much extra money trying to get back to the UK. And, although I deeply support and understand the current COVID19 sensitivity and the required guidelines, I suffer from severe eczema on my face, which makes me medically exempt from face masks. I still do my best to put up with the pain and wear a face mask for as many hours as I can.  Wearing one for a prolonged amount of time causes bleeding and a lot of pain. After the first 2 hours of the journey, my skin needed a break, but when I informed the attendants, they told me unless I had a medical report from a hospital, I wasn’t allowed to take it off. UK laws strictly prohibit anyone from asking for a medical report to prove you are exempt from face masks due to a medical disability, which can be seen on the government website. However, Eurostar is clearly exempt from government guidelines. I felt really embarrassed trying to explain my health condition, which feels so private, and the UK guidelines to an attendant while the whole carriage listened.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Eurotrash!	Had tickets booked from Paris to London. Five days before we were due to travel, we got a message saying our train had been cancelled, but we would be issued with a voucher, which we could offset against future travel.If a service provider fails to provided the service which has been contractually agreed, without offering a valid reason, then they are in breach of contract. Eurostar's reson was 'Covid-19 restrictions'. At the time, the restrictions were no different to when we made our outward journey so this was nonsense. In any case, if they don't provide the service, they are legally obliged to make a full refund.Anyway, to continue. Although our train was cancelled, they had another one available, for which we could book tickets at almost 4 X the cost of the original ones. You might ask why they didn't simply offer us travel on that train using our original tickets, if seats were available. We wondered that too and emailed Eurostar, but three days later, there is still no reply.Effectively, Eurostar abandoned its customers in a foreign country and offered not a jot of support, simply asking for more money. Bearing in mind the current situation, I would put this on the same level as profiteering in wartime. Their behaviour is absolutely despicable.Despite the inconvenience and added time, I will be driving to Europe in future, rather than travelling with this bunch of crooks	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Lost A Loyal Customer	I've staying in travelled many times with Eurostar, and was generally happy with them, so was expecting a reasonable approach during the Covid times. However, their policies have left me significantly out of pocket so I won't be travelling with them again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Fares remain unspeakably high, shops mainly closed at Gar Du Nord (although other shops seem to be able to open), whilst it seems possible on French railways to buy food, this seems to her beyond possible for Eurostar. And still no reduction, despite this, in fares	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Eurostar trying to profit from quarantines	In the middle of recently announced quarantines, Eurostar has removed its free exchange option, in that a fee applies for any change within 14 days. I just tried to change my ticket for one where the change fee was minimal. I had to update my payment details first. Within a few minutes, all change options are now £75! Being held over a barrel, shocking behaviour	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Taking advantage of Covid to rip off customers	No answer from customer service Didn't appreciate they have used Covid-19 and travel restrictions to increase their prices and force people to pay double to travel back. Also never book another train ticket on Eurostar. They offer the bookings but won't take responsibility if the train is late and you miss your connection ( and they don't plan enough time between connections).	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Voucher arrived promptly	I asked for a voucher because I had to cancel my second attempt at going to Amsterdam because of Covid. The voucher was issued the same day. I just hope that I'm not going to have to pay more when I rebook for May 2021!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	4
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Unfortunately it seems Eurostar are an awful company.	Horrible company it turns out. I prefer the train to flying but I will definitely reconsider after my recent experience with Eurostar. Also refund money you owe, it’s tantamount to theft!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Legitimate Scam	I can't be bothered to type everything out again. Let's just say, I have been scammed. Got an evoucher and rebooked, now they want money to change it as it falls outside their arbritrary dates. No support, no help, cant change destination (which may have helped with date change), dates for next year unavaliable.Legitimate scam. I would expect this from a dodgy chinese advertised on Facebook, not a company like this.Unfortunately, good intentions of being green should remain just that. Let's destroy the planet because these clowns can't pull their finger out. Catch me flying.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Over 4 months a still no refund	Like many others we have been trying for over four months to claim a refund for a cancelled train. They try to fob you off with a voucher despite the fact they are legally obliged to give refunds. Despite repeated emails we have just received one holding reply over three months ago. All the other train companies we booked for our holiday have sent prompt refunds. There is no excuse for this appalling lack of service. It seems they are trying to minimise the number of refunds paid.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	They refuse to give any refunds for Covid-19	They refuse to give any refunds for trips canceled because of Government restrictions on travel due to Covid-19.  We tried to re-book 3 times and each time the governments of both France and the UK have banned us from traveling in and out of their countries and yet Eurostar continues to keep our money!  EVERY other airline and train company has given us our money back.  Eurostar STILL refuses!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	I had the worst eurostar experience…	I had the worst eurostar experience yesterday 23 October 2020, afternoon train. It is been few weeks/months that eurostar is struggling with covid, constantly cancelling bookings. Those cancellated booking are free of charge replacement. But those ticket always disappear from the eurostar app. So it is difficult to track ticket whose has been cancelled. So you always have to go back to your booking emails, if you still have them. It is OK if you one ticket cancelled but when you have 10 return tickets it is really painful and not clear. In addition, you cannot change them on the app as from time to time it does not work. So as I could not change my ticket I went to eurostar yesterday beforr departure as i have done it several times before, I asked someone to change my ticket to the next departure. But, when I arrived they had no one from eurostar able to change my cancelled tickets due to a reduction of staf in the station. But had 3 people there to say 'hi' to people!? Find the error !The staf there was berly speaking French. Feel really offended that the line manager present there expected me to speak with me in  flamish to explain the current issue.  Feel a bit of racism! She did not want to help me at all.Later on, an other lady arrived, a bit late 15minutes before departure. She was almost having an heart attack when the eurostar line manager told her she cannot get in. The line manage and her colleague have not moved a fingers in order to help this poor lady while having an shorten breath. She would have let her die. It is unbelievable how eurostar is dealing with covid issue. It is the worst experience I have ever had. How people can be that unrespectful?Eurostar should review they staf and find helpful staf, willing to help passengers in this diffucult time and not make the passanger life even more diffucult. Next time I will travel by flight.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Thieves	I was notified less that 24 hours before my departure that my return ticket was cancelled. With both reduced Eurostar service and current Sncf Covid schedules there is just no trains that connects on time anymore for my journey back. That meant that if I were to take the inbound journey I would end up stranded in France. The only option I had left with was to change my journey from Strasbourg-London via Lille instead of Paris. Eurostar refused to change this leg of the journey for me despite the inconvenience they caused. They told me the only option I had was to get the voucher and rebook the entire journey back. But the entire journey back including changing the Sncf trains last minute would have cost us 2.5x the price of our original tickets. No compensation, no help, just a stressful two hours on the phone arguing with them to end up with nothing. Holidays cancelled. Oh and yes now I need to wait 28 days to be able to use up my voucher. Thieves.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Problem 2: I have a trip to the UK next week and my train both ways was canceled, I was told to change my train free of charge but when I go to manage my booking all the options are paid. I am being asked to pay £105 for changing my trains. I now tried several times to log in and log out from my account, once I saw the options to be free (which is how it should be) so I selected the options and pressed a button to change my ticket, but guess what the Eurostar website decided to crash. It's saying ""we are almost there"" for the past 15 minutes. So as a result I still did not manage to change my tickets.

Although our train was cancelled, they had another one available, for which we could book tickets at almost 4 X the cost of the original ones. You might ask why they didn't simply offer us travel on that train using our original tickets, if seats were available. We wondered that too and emailed Eurostar, but three days later, there is still no reply.Effectively, Eurostar abandoned its customers in a foreign country and offered not a jot of support, simply asking for more money. Bearing in mind the current situation, I would put this on the same level as profiteering in wartime. Their behaviour is absolutely despicable.Despite the inconvenience and added time, I will be driving to Europe in future, rather than travelling with this bunch of crooks	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Lost A Loyal Customer	I've staying in travelled many times with Eurostar, and was generally happy with them, so was expecting a reasonable approach during the Covid times. However, their policies have left me significantly out of pocket so I won't be travelling with them again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Eurostar trying to profit from quarantines	In the middle of recently announced quarantines, Eurostar has removed its free exchange option, in that a fee applies for any change within 14 days. I just tried to change my ticket for one where the change fee was minimal. I had to update my payment details first. Within a few minutes, all change options are now £75! Being held over a barrel, shocking behaviour	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1
2020-11-12T14:44:50Z	Taking advantage of Covid to rip off customers	No answer from customer service Didn't appreciate they have used Covid-19 and travel restrictions to increase their prices and force people to pay double to travel back. Also never book another train ticket on Eurostar. They offer the bookings but won't take responsibility if the train is late and you miss your connection ( and they don't plan enough time between connections).	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.eurostar.com	1

Later went to visit family in Frodsham. When I tried to return home that train was cancelled too. It was supposedly being replaced by a bus service. No information about when this bus was supposed to arrive. Waited over an hour for a bus that never turned up. I eventually managed to get home at 11 pm,  two hours later than intended. I contacted the company and was given three completely conflicting reasons why trains were cancelled by rude and aggressive staff. They seem to go out of their way to provoke callers to give them an excuse to hang up. On train staff are just as bad.Complaining does nothing. They either completely ignore you or (as has happened to me numerous times) they lie and Claim  all the services are running normally and on time. The trains themselves are a disgrace. They are often overcrowded and filthy. One has a pile of vomit ON THE SEAT that has been there so long it has fur growing on it.Transport for wales are a utterly useless.

The letter does not deliver a sincere apology but rather an attitude of take it and stop complaining. I wouldn’t take this damn train company if I had a choice. The app isn’t great either, the live times are not live at all, it states that it will go from A to B ON TIME but gets terminated in the middle of nowhere.

I waited approx 30 mins for train and I watched them for all this time. If this is happening at a small station , then GOD HELP the amount of not required staff at other stations.

On a daily basis their us at list one issue with this commute, there are never enough seats and overcrowding is rife. Delays are the norm and an almost daily occurrence. This morning I tried to catch the 7:19 train from Cwmbran - cancelled, so waited around for the next train in 30 minutes, I couldn’t get on (along with about 30 other people) it due to overcrowding! - the train only had 2 carriages for a peak time service?!?!?Its a complete shambles. Its over priced (especially with recent increase which dumbfound me with on how this can be justified) and far cheaper for me to drive to work on a daily basis. Only started getting the train as trying to do some good and help the environment but the unreliability, cost and service of TfW means I can’t even do that!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	1

2020-11-04T10:01:11Z	Late, Cancelled, Packed and Extortionate	Transport for Wales are absolutely dreadful. Words do not describe this absolutely disgraceful company. Every single day without fail my train is either late or cancelled and often so rammed due to a massive shortage of carriages that I can't even get on the train. Every year the prices go up and the service gets worse and TFW do not seem to care one bit. The trains are old, they smell and evidently haven't ever been cleaned properly. I'm paying over 19 pounds per week for 3 stops (all within Cardiff) and they do not even have the decency to get me to work on time.This is affecting my career drastically as I'm often late, even if I try and get the earlier train. I'm sick and tired of being ripped off for an abysmal service, yet I am still forced to pay as it is my only viable way of getting into work. TFW know this is the case for most people so they do not feel obliged to improve their services as they know no matter how bad it gets, they will always turn a massive profit.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	1

Dozens of people unable to board the already packed train. Eventually arrived at Queen Street station to find my connecting train had no driver as he was delayed on yet another late running train! Transport for Wales puts up the fares then reduces their service leaving passengers stranded on platforms! Yesterday morning they operated another 2 carriage train instead of 4 leaving dozens of passengers stranded. This afternoon I was informed that my train home would terminate at Cardiff Central and that a replacement bus service was at the back of Cardiff Central Station. When I got there I was informed that there was no replacement bus service! Go to Wood Street and get Cardiff bus home. Boarded Cardiff bus which was packed due to rail passengers boarding. Passengers left at bus stop as bus full. Other passengers at other bus stops left in despair and rain as the bus I was on drove past them without stopping. Disgusting extortionate service run by incompetent managers. James Price and Ken Skates enjoy earning thousands of pounds a week whilst many train passengers earning hundreds of pounds a month have to suffer!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	1

2020-11-04T10:01:11Z	Reliably inconsistent!!!!!	I rely on trains to get to and from work. Trains are consistently late which consistently makes me late for work and I often have to wait 3+ hours for the next train. Also, road transport is not often available. Even when I call the transport for Wales number they say that road transport isn’t not available. Today I called up and asked if road transport was available and a lady on the other end said yes it is. The transport was late so I rang again. They said wait another 10-15 mins. Waited. Called again and same thing. Finally a bus did arrive but was not going to Pembroke. I had been waiting over an hour. I am really disappointed with the transport and consequently, my job is on the line because of trouble getting to work. I am trying to make a living and the inconsistency of trains is affecting this. I have even had to walk home from penally, Pembrokeshire to Pembroke, Pembrokeshire because there were no transport. I’m assuming this is not just affecting me. This will affect people across Wales and will affect people’s careers. Your inconsistency to deliver your services may be contributing to unemployment rates across Wales. could I ask, would anyone working for transport for Wales be happy with the service they deliver? Please sort this out. This type of thing happens nearly every week for me and many others and it’s frustrating.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	1

2019-11-29T10:01:27Z	Trains like cattle wagons	Arriva Trains Wales, now Transport for Wales, is the epitome of awfulness when it comes to public transport. The trains are old, smell bad, and are quite dirty in some places. I don’t ever dare to go near the toilets to be honest. The trains are also overcrowded, with an unsuitable amount of carriages often chosen for the time of day. On Sundays, they decide to use 2x3 carriage trains in some cases, don’t know what that is all about but I wish they could do this during rush hour. Something I don’t understand is that the oldest trains they use usually are the cleanest and don’t smell, however they are quite noisy. The seats inside the standard ex. Arriva Trains Wales carriages are extremely uncomfortable and hurt my back. The arrival times to the station are often inconsistent, including the 8:15am train from Ludlow to Cardiff Central. Luckily, I do not take this train, but feel sorry for those who do due to the fact that it is consistently 15 minutes late each day. All of this horrific service for an expensive price, I wonder what we are really paying for. To sum it up, they basically need new trains.

2019-11-29T10:01:27Z	Worse trains and service I have ever seen.	"If I could put 0 star I would have. Comming from France I thought our regional train system was bad but this is another level. I've been commuting every day for work on the Bidston - Wrexham line and just in the last week I had 4 trains cancelled. Twice because a car hit a bridge, once for flooding after 10min of proper rain and last time for unknown reasons. The worse part is not even the cancels, it is how they deal with it. You know the train is cancelled just as it is suppose to arrive even though it is the same problem as the day before or you get in and have to get out at the next station without prior warrants. You end up somewhere you don't know, nobody cares about how you are suppose to get home so what do you do ? You call the line that is not even aware you train is cancelled and ask for help. The poor guy tries to help you: ""M. there is a bus comming for replacement, should be there anytime"". You think you're saved, finally able to go home. What a mistake you've made you fool. The bus never ever came. Waited twice for this supposed bus for more than an hour and it never came. At this point you might think I've been unlucky but it happens all the time. My coworkers have the same experience with the service. And to top it all it is expensive. Seriously do something because right now it is just an adverstisment to get a car."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	1
2019-11-29T10:01:27Z	Appalling, complacent, couldn't care less	"I am a rare reviewer. Only review excellence or extreme incompetence. Guess which one applies in this case ... As for many reviewers of arriva trains, one star is far too many. Boarded 11.50 cross country from taunton to derby this morning. Station announcement was for 8 coach train with at seat buffet service. Reality is as follows: Only front 4 coaches of train open with no advance warning; so people waiting to board down length of platform;  Had to run small child and elderly parent down platform to force us thru door already crammed with overflow customers and luggage; Spoke briefly to train departer on platform who said he knew nothing about half train being shut and I would have to speak to train manager (see below for evidence of his existence); People crammed in corridors outside stinking toilets because no seating management on train; Only 3 carriages standard class, reducing seating even further; Finally managed to find seat with help of fellow passenger - still no train staff to be seen; No announcement from train manager about travelling circumstances although he was happy to make lengthy station announcements. In the end I pointed the few spare seats that were scattered about out to people including elderly passengers struggling to balance in passageways; No at seat service - in fact no evidence of a buffet car at all, although I wouldn't have got to it anyway due to previously mentioned corridor crowding; No ticket checking so no one to complain to. Suspect train ""manager"" hiding No reservations. Seating was a free-for-all, with some people claiming reservations and others quietly accepting their grim, expensive fate. Free wifi didn't work; Finally got an announcement at Birmingham about overcrowding- blamed on ""planned engineering work"". What does that have to do with a train running at half capacity?? To top it all, there was a banner across my window reminding me that arriva wants everyone to have a great journey so asking passengers to please be considerate to each other. If only they cared enough to see the irony ... Located train ""manager"" (owen) when I got off train  at derby. On requesting apology I got the stock ""I'm sorry YOU feel that way, madam"" at which I had to explain it was nothing to do with how I FEEL. It was about my experience. No apology for that of course...I will be pursuing this. Every aspect of this shambles is totally and utterly inexcusable. I paid over £100 to watch this farce unfold. Never again ...

The roof is broken at Newport and leaks water all over the passengers, the stations are archaic, and Transport for Wales trains are uncomfortable sheds from the 80s, most without luggage racks, and female train managers with a misplaced sense of “girl power” who bark at you for your suitcase being in the way because there’s no luggage rack! - Maybe remove the bloody food trolly from the small trains, instead, and tell the cyclists to cycle instead of bringing their bikes on board a tiny two carriage train at rush hour!Some of the trains have dangerous doors like those on old buses, which can be opened easily by hand whilst travelling, putting passengers at risk of being thrown out of a moving train by a violent passenger on board. I’ve seen better trains in poorer parts of Eastern Europe, and Britain is meant to be the 5th wealthiest nation in the world?! What a joke! Re-nationalise British Rail, and sack the rude, ignorant staff currently working on the trains and stations. Then there’s the station guard at Port Talbot, who is one of the biggest a-holes I’ve met at a Transport for Wales train station, and that’s saying something! His train whistle would be better placed where the sun doesn’t shine. I was victim to a train diversion, and had to get off at a small-town station, then hitch a lift to Port Talbort Parkway to try and catch my train as it passed through. I just made it! I hurriedly hurled my heavy luggage up the stairs, across the bridge, and down to the platform as I didn’t have time to wait for the lift - The train had just pulled in. I literally made it to the train doors as they were closing, in the middle of an asthma attack after rushing with my case. I was standing there desperately pressing the train door’s button, to try and open them. The aforementioned guard yelled at me to stand back, whilst I pleaded at him between gasps to please let me on the train. He kept yelling at me. I collapsed on the platform. No assistance was given. He just walked off and left me there, sitting on the cold stone ground, gasping for breath, like I was nothing. I was left alone there for an entire hour waiting for the next train, with no water, no cafe - nothing(!), until the next London train came along. If this is an example of “Welsh hospitality”, I’ll do without, thanks. Thank God I left Wales. I’ve already sent and official complaint to Transport for Wales and GWR, but Transport for Wales never responded! - Surprise, surprise!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	1

2019-11-29T10:01:27Z	Utterly useless	Since this company has taken over I have been late for work a ridiculous amount of times because of late trains, and despite their website stating that trains later than 15 minutes will mean you get a reduced rate not a single ticked person will do anything for you. Also the amount of cancelled trains seems to have multiplied significantly since they came along. Utterly useless. **UPDATE** train turned up half an hour late and now the operator is standing outside his cabin playing on his phone. I'm getting fed up with these people. I'm now late for work AGAIN and they just stand there with a big grin on their face.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	1

A few issues at Cardiff central train station they were only taking cash payments on this day. No idea why even the self ticketing machines were cash only.So I went to use the cash machine directly outside the station. There are 2 machines available one was out of service. So waited in the queue for the only working one. Soon as I got to the front of the queue the cash machine displayed out of service.So I explained this to the train guard who said ok pay on the train. Got on the train checked the prices of open return via trainline. They were quoting £10.80 each way. So £21.60 open return.When it came to the train conductor asking for tickets I thought I'll just check how much he says the cost of the tickets are. He checked his point of sale machine £11.90 open return. So wallop good job I waited saved £10.The train was clean had a point where I could charge my tablet so outward journey no issues.The return journey all good except no charging in point in any of the carriages that I was permitted to be seated. Dont know whether there were points in 1st class didn't check but for Pete's sake 2019 no charging points near any of the seats. Not good enough.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	3

When you finally get to the point of purchase, you can't get your ticket, you have to go to a station, but many rural stations have no ticket machines or offices! Brilliant! Another nasty scam is the ticket macines which will sell you a first class ticket for a train that has no first class seating!If you are busy, travel by car. If you are not in a hurry, walk, Both options are better than Transport for Wales.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	1

2019-07-04T15:48:54Z	Terrible	"The worst train service I have ever seen, they even have better rail services in Europe... their trains are so old they just keep ""refurbishing"" them by painting over the outside... they're robbing people blind... it's nearly 3 quid every 1 stop which is like a 2 mile journey. Their trains stink of faeces/urine and vomit sometimes.. as soon as I use their services I feel like I'm stepping into a different dimension, it doesn't feel like I'm in the U.K anymore. Their staff are ok, but I have been hearing and seeing so many people being stopped by so called revenue protection officers to pilfer as much money as possible from people before it's gone.. who's regulating these cowboys???"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	1
2019-07-04T15:48:54Z	Probably the worst rail service in Europe, yet the most expensive.	Everything about them is a travesty. Old and filthy rolling stock, loos not working, trains crowded to lethal levels, running the minimum possible service and either running late or not at all, as the driver is miles away as a result of previous late runnng. Their official excuse from the PR department before the franchise renewal was 'there are no easy or quick answers' which is total b.s. If they cared they would have had more rolling stock, drivers and maintenance - but hey, that would affect profits, wouldn't it? Last night I heard an obsequios announcement while waiting at Hereford for a (yes, you've guessed it) late running train announcing how proud they have been to provide a 'service' for the last 15 years. If that's real, then they're showing total contempt for all of their 'customers'. Yeah right Arriva, you can sod off as well. You won't be missed.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	1
2019-07-04T15:48:54Z	Everything about them is a travesty	Absolutely awful. cancelled very often, rarely get a seat and usually dirty, noisy uncomfortable. Moved houses because I could still commute via a single train journey, now considering leaving my job because the last month of getting to work by Arriva trains has been absolutely appalling. Above all, no refund for season holders no matter how long the delay is and the tickets cost a lot too compared to other train providers.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	1
2019-07-04T15:48:54Z	Absolutely awful	Trains are dirty and smelly, staff are surly, trains are frequently late.

Absolutely appalling.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	1
2019-07-04T15:48:54Z	Awful.	Fortunately it is very rare I use public transport as I drive everywhere. The rare occasions I use the train they are dirty and late ( sometimes cancelled).

2019-07-04T15:48:54Z	Awful, unreliable & dirty trains, avoid if you can.	If I could give these characters no stars I would.On booking there was no option to  have the tickets posted to me unless they could be signed for with next day delivery. As I was away from home that wasn't an option so I had to use the ticket machine at Caersws to collect them. That was out of order. So I drove to Newtown and there was no ticket machine there and as it was Saturday the station ticket office had closed at 1230.Anyway... The trains are always late, overcrowded and dirty. I had  reserved seats on a recent journey and all my seats had been double reserved.I am so thoroughly sick of having to travel on Arriva Trains Wales.

Reserved seats 24 hrs prior to travel (not much notice but British weather is unpredictable, therefor book late)People in our seats when we got on, thankfully they got off at the next stop. Got comfortable in our seats and then had mixed instructions about journey to Barmouth from Wolverhampton. Online states no change for outward journey.  Train staff told us to get off the train at Machynlleth and board another train.  Later on told that the train splits in two and we should move into different carriage, no need for change. There goes our reserved seats. Hot stuffy carriages until train staff come along with a window tool to open the windows eventually. Dirty toilets. Return journey equally stressful.  Not enough carriages and lots of people standing for part of their journey.  Reserve seats that I pre booked do not exist on the way home.  Tired children and pensioner, got seats for them eventually after having to stand up for the first part of return journey meanwhile I was sat in the luggage rack. Toilets still dirty.

2018-08-08T16:15:45Z	This train company is the worst	Absolutely diabolical company, continuing to charge high prices for a second rate service. Practically every one of the services they run that I've been on in the North West has been filled to the brink and there appears to be little being done to address this issue, aside from excuses over an inability to hire more coaches. Baffling that they've been able to hold onto the contract for so long, amazed that there hasn't been an intervention from a governing body.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	1
2018-08-08T16:15:45Z	Absolutely diabolical company	I can't remember the last time I got an arriva train that run on time and wasn't totally rammed. I attempted to get a 6.45 train from llansamlet to cardiff recently. 15 minutes before it was due to arrive it was simply cancelled. If it wasn't for my gf being able to drop me to neath to get a great Western  I simply wouldn't have got to work. Today I am attempting to get the 11.19 from cardiff to Fishguard. I turned up at the station to find a four carriage train that was actually early. After boarding the train and actually managing to get a seat we were told to get off the train as it had been cancelled.A new train turned up for us which was smaller than our original train and for no reason which was explained to us the front carriage, which was a normal carriage, was designated  not for passenger use. This meant we were now crammed in like stupid sardines, service as normal for arriva.  Of course year on year without fail the prices across the board increase yet the quality of service declines in an inverse relationship to the price.It is a national scandal that the British public are beholden to these useless private train operators. Each provider obviously has a monopoly on certain routes and times which means that the customer cannot vote with their wallet and allow these useless companies to go bankrupt as they deserve and which is what would and should happen in a truly free market.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	1

He deserves recognition for his quality service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	2
2018-08-08T16:15:45Z	Top quality service today on the 09.35 …	I was about to board the 16:25 from Birmingham New street to Shrewsbury, my daily commute on 30/01/2018. As usual the train was disgustingly overfilled (a complaint for a separate occasion). Most carriages were filled right up to the doors. I noticed the final carriage had a fair amount of space by the rear doors as well as down the isle. Aware of this I was about to board (in a rush as there was only a minute left before the train departed) where a rather tall male conductor blocked my path and explained rather rudely that I could not board this section of the train as it was 'full' now I'm no expert in the physics of space in trains but compared to the other carriages this area was by far the emptiest, with there being enough space easily for another 15 people, I explained this to the conductor. But he was having none of it. Concerned by the lack of time i now had due to this rude arrogant man I had no choice now but to run off to somehow find another area with space for me to board. In my frustration of this incident, as I was walking off I shouted 'useless' to which the train manager I had just had my encounter with started screaming 'excuse me' .... 'EXCUSE ME' in my direction. I continued to run to another carriage where I could board, ignoring this man as I was concerned I would not get on the train and I didn't have time to deal with him again. At this point as I was midway between the end carriage he started to run after me. To which I then stopped in shear shock of this action. He then got within 7 inches of my face (somerging I perceive as a servere breach of my personal space), to then go on to scream and spit once again at me asking what I said, to which I replied 'I said useless. He then asked 'do you want to board this train' to which I replied of course. To this response he then walked off obviously feeling that he had asserted his fake authority on me. Firstly in my response to this incident I should say that never before in my year and a half of daily commuting have I seen anything like this and at the time of writing this and still in shear anger and shock. It was bad enough being told I couldn't board a certain section of train. But to then be chased after, shamed and screamed at is utterly disgraceful. It should be noted that throughout the whole incident I felt extremely intimidated and physically threatened by this individual and am considering reporting this to the police if action is not taken. I volunteer at a reserve military unit and not even in that line of work have I ever been screamed at in the way he did to me. The whole time he demonstrated no customer service skills and made me very very frightened. I have no other choice but travel on your disgusting services daily but having a man like this managing your trains certainly isn't helping you any become any better.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	5

Sadly a frequent occurrence and if you've made a seat reservation you might as well forget it, they probably won't have placed it. The trains are also often crowded with no available seats, especially at peak times, you'd think they'd prepare. Top top it all off the trains themselves aren't in the greatest condition, I hear quite often of engine failures and faults, and quite a lot have dirty interiors, particularly the trays on the back of the seats. It's a shame I have no choice but to rely on them daily for my commute.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	2

The trains are old and clearly the company has severe capacity issues as many times services are reduced from the usual 4 coaches down to 2.Bearing in mind that they’re the biggest service from the whole of Shropshire and Wales into Birmingham, this causes severe inconvenience.The rush hour trains out of Birmingham are consistently packed with standing room only.They are mostly punctual, though, so one start extra for that.All in all, I hope they lose the franchise as they’re clearly unfit for purpose.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk	2

2018-01-09T09:57:49Z	Arriva Trains Wales is a pile of rubbish	"Arriva Trains Wales is a pile of rubbish. I spent £10.00 on child return Train ticket being a 16 year old. Only to realise once we get on the train that a 16 year old is actually an adult. As I understand rules are rules I don't agree with how the conductor did it. He was extremely rude and belligerent. Threatening to prosecute us after not understanding the rules. In a very intimidating manor he decided start an argument with us about how the ""youths"" of today try to blame everyone else. I feel this man took a large amount of pleasure in threatening young children. On top of this we then had to pay more, and we weren't allowed a refund for our child's ticket. Overall I spent over £30 for a ticket that originally should have costed less than £10. This man was a large rectum with a rubbish beard. Probably is a virgin, and gets no pussy whatsoever. I hope he is reading this as he needs to take a long hard look at himself and realise he is a bellend.

They are almost never late, and if they are, they have the decency to apologise (are your reading this Northern???), find you an alternative and give you the money back, should you qualify for a reimbursement.

They actually made me sit closer to the other passengers, breaking the social distancing rules.When I expressed my opinion about ridiculousness of the situation to the train manager, he said, that if I find it ridiculous I shouldn’t be using a public transport and I can feel free to jump off the train at the nearest station. He acted like he was deliberately trying to provoke a conflict. I wasn’t aggressive of offensive in any way, so I don’t think I deserved to be treated like a yob, like the Cross Country staff was doing me a favour letting me using their service. The train manager was extremely rude and offensive and I never experienced this kind of behaviour before.

Now you would think despite social distancing that they would have given us a least a bottle of water? but no. I think I'll stick to standard if this is the best Crosscountrycan do.

I knew there wasn’t service in the carriage but I was told passengers would get a complimentary pack from the snack bar. I went to collect my ‘pack’ and it consisted of a cup of tea and a tiny Genoa slice. Given my journey spanned the lunch period I thought I’d get a sandwich at least and a bottle of water. I contacted them via twitter and they just said ‘thanks for the feedback’. I paid £150 for the ticket! Absolutely appalling. Virgin used to provide free water in first class, free drinks and even on weekends you got a proper snack box.

2020-11-09T05:45:33Z	Terrible Customer Service - No Covid Refunds	I was unable to use the train tickets I'd purchased due to being in an area which had been put on local lockdown. I had only purchased them the day before. All other trains I had booked with other train services for the same week gave me a full refund apart from Cross Country Trains who refused. They said that I should book new tickets which have to be from the same train station that I had previously booked from and the ticket price needed to be the same or higher and that this would be my 'refund'. That is not a refund, that's just poor customer service. It shows a willingness to allow people to travel who shouldn't be, putting others in danger.

Due to this we didn't take any food and drink. When we boarded we were told that there was no catering at all! Not even water, we had a 4 hour 45min trip with nothing!Customer service not interested and do not accept they have a duty of care to their customers. Having, at very least, water should be available, especially for passengers travelling such a distance. There is now a limited service available but on our return this was available at the other end of the train from 1st class.We have been offered £30 in vouchers, against a £235 each ticket (£470 total).

2020-11-09T05:45:33Z	Extremely dissatisfied with the service…	"Extremely dissatisfied with the service and their customer care. I have booked a season ticket and with the booking confirmation, they have shared a customer care number. I was waiting for more than 1 hour 15 min for talking with a customer care representative and after that time, one lady(Ms Churni Khasnobis) picked up the call.I have two points: 1. I have requested for a partial cancellation on 05 Mar to my booking from Leicester to Chesterfield which was planned on 06 Mar over a telephone. The representative confirmed my cancellation. Even after so many days they haven't processed my refund. I came to know today that the payment was rejected as I have activated my ticket before cancelling it. As far I know in UK you can't activate a ticket before the travel day. So I think technically it is not possible. Finally after lot of discussion she has connected me to her manager who has verbally confirmed me that she will be reprocessing my cancellation. I am not sure what will happen next.Point 2: I had to request cancelling my current season ticket for rest of the days as my Office is not allowing working from office anymore due to current situation. The number I dialled as I have received with my season ticket booking from Cross country. Now she has provided me with another no: 03445561344 and told me that this is the number for season ticket department. The question here is if they are not suppose to answer for season tickets then why a other department numbers were given for contacting further on season ticket and harassing and wasting customers time?Do you think that after waiting for more than 1 and half hour, you will l just answer with a alternative phone number and will say ""sorry for the inconvenience caused"" is sufficient for the customer?I am highly dissatisfied with cross-country and will definitely not going to use it for any of my future bookings."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

Cardiff to Nottingham, Exeter-Leeds and Birmingham-Leicester. The tickets have gotten more expensive and the crowding has got worse.Why oh why does the team who plan the Rolling stock allocations think that a 2 carriage Turbo star is acceptable on the rush hour services from Birmingham to Cardiff. Surely the volume of seat reservations on the service is an indication of use. It is no longer acceptable. I have seen 1980s and 2000s rolling stock attached together to form longer trains for west Midlands trains, so why not do similar for cross country rush hour trains. You could couple them up at New street, then couple them at Gloucester. Is that really so difficult to do? Or is it simply about the money. If it is. The cross country execs should receive no bonus and should be held responsible. It's an embarrassment for UK railways.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

We started the first part of our journey with GWR who both know how to operate trains (doubling the 5 carriages at Plymouth to accommodate the numbers of travellers) and look after their customers giving a great standard of service on the train. I haven’t seen a single member of cross country staff today. Mind you not surprising as they can’t make it through due to everyone standing. 4 coaches with half as many seats as GWR trains and to top that the last coach is first class with no one in it. You need to review your operating model, it doesn’t work for your customers, you know the ones that pay your wages and keep your business afloat.

When I boarded couldn’t get on as people in space between the carriages and gangways.  Luggage everywhere, gave up and got off. Waited 30 mins for next train - going to Glasgow. Again 5 carriages, packed but I had to make the journey and eventually a seat became available. I was lucky to be near it as so many people were standing. This shocking service continues - I have no choice but to use Cross Country. In newspapers Arriva, who have contract in Germany reducing fares but increasing fares in U.K. Hiw can they justify this, hiw can they continue to be awarded the contract when not enough rolling stock which apparently is the reason max five carriages on my journey.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

2020-01-22T16:55:06Z	Great on-board team	What an unexpected experience!!  I jumped onto XC after being left stranded, again, by TransPennine Express.  The train guard was great.  In the chaos caused at Newcastle by TPE a fellow passenger found himself on the wrong train.  The XC Guard could not have been kinder.  She immediately set about working out his options and gave clear information as to how to get where he needed to be.The food trolley then arrived and the lady walked the length of the train to find me something to eat and delivered it back to me.  It was also very tasty!!It cannot be 5 stars simply because the rolling stock is rather old now but the on-board team more than made up for that and frankly deserved 6!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	4

No first class service on this train, other than slightly wider seat(!). I flew down to Exeter and next time I make this journey it will be by plane both ways. I couldn’t recommend First Class on  Cross Country trains as the service offered, at least on this occasion, doesn’t match what’s quoted on the website.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

2019-12-07T09:48:37Z	Many of the franchised rail services…	"Many of the franchised rail services are poor, but Arriva owned Cross Country just HAS to be the worst.Travelled Southampton to Birmingham yesterday. The train was announced (and used to be) a five carriage unit but, to maximise profits at expense of passengers, Cross Country have reduced all to four car units, taking out the unreserved seating car. Reserving a seat makes no difference as, for more than one sector of the journey, three passengers had tickets with same seat allocated.So I had to stand (along with many other passengers) for all but short sectors when an unreserved seat became available - continual 'musical chairs' but without the music. No sign of the guard, who was hiding from passengers' frustration. The return journey was worse, because the previous service had been cancelled. In front of the waiting passengers, our train passed a red light, at New Street, to pull to the wrong end of the platform, which meant that there was a high-speed complete crush of two trains-worth of waiting passengers to get to the train. Very dangerous! No announcements for this or any of the other delays or discomforts. Fellow regularly suffering passengers have complained but get stupid responses from Cross Country's people (probably a call centre in India): ""Our metrics show that these trains are under used, do we have taken a carriage out""; ""The Government won't let us run five car trains anymore""; etc.  Clearly as rubbish as their trains and so-called service.Dreadful, dreadful, dreadfully.

Then there’s an announcement - blah, blah (std guff about the journey etc) followed by “don’t be alarmed if you see the driver walk from the front of the train to the rear; just a minutes delay, with a 17 minute delay due to a signal”.The driver does pass down to the rear, the train revs up, then we travel backwards - yes “backwards”.....!I’m typing this as it happens, anyone finding this communique - please let my family know I love them !	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

2019-11-06T12:46:34Z	always overcrowded and not guaranteed a seat	Cross Country trains are 1 of 3 companies that supply trains to and from my local town. When you get on there is only a 50% chance you will get a seat at any time of day due to the amount of people that use the service which runs every 30-60 mins. Sometimes it is standing room only and you are unable to move more than a few inches without banging into a stranger.Some of the carriages also have bins that are dirty/smelly or that aren't fully secure while I get that this cant always be checked during the day it should be cleaned/emptied at least 2 times a day if there is always a lot of people using the trains.Some of the conductors can also come across as confrontational whether they mean to or not without naming and shaming I recently travelled on a cross country train and tried to buy a ticket from my local station to see that no one was in the ticket office this meant I had to use the machine and being unable to find the railcard option I decided to buy my ticket on the train. When the conductor came round I tried to explain the situation where his response was there's a machine at the station and you have to get a ticket before you get on which is what I was fully aware of. He then started to get confrontational and starting talking to me like I was a criminal even though I would've happily paid for a ticket and saying I couldn't have my discount which I have never been told before when I've brought a ticket on a train. I later found out the reason was so he could get more commission from me buying a ticket from him which is unfair to anyone who pays for a yearly railcard as they are entitled to a discount both on and off trains.Wouldn't say this is the best company to use from my mixed experience even though they have been fairly quick to give me a refund for a delayed train when I have tried to claim part of my money back.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

Cross Country excelled themselves this week with their Southampton to Manchester service.Despite the fact Southampton were playing at Manchester City, and it was obviously going to be more overcrowded than usual we got the usual 4 carriage train again. I got on at Banbury, by which point it was already 45 minutes late, then at Birmingham they decided the train wasn't going to Manchester any more, but Aberdeen.So all change to another train which got into Manchester 45 minutes late.Coming back was even more of a shambles with the train being 35 minutes late, after the previous train being cancelled, then a serious assault in the carriage I was in because two people had the same seat reserved in different trains.After the assailant was arrested and witness statements taken, CC decided to delay even longer and make the late 18:27 into the 19:27.With regards to the assault, although the person who committed it was responsible, Cross Country created the circumstances with their total disregard for their customer's safety and well-being.Disgraceful.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

2019-11-06T12:46:34Z	Inadequate capacity	The Crosscountry train franchise operates over some of the longest distance and most useful routes in the country, yet has huge lack of capacity, poor frequency and reliability.The Voyager trains are far too small for demand, even in First Class, and the staff seem unable or unwilling to enforce the seat reservation system which is frequently ignored due to overcrowding.Given the prime routes, mostly avoiding London, it is a shame that this company is not a beacon of quality rather than the disgrace they are in practice.I avoid them if at all possible.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	2

The seat booking system is chaotic etc. All I can add to previous reviews is that the ticket reclaim system (for late or cancelled trains) is so overwhelmed and under-staffed that it also fails to meet its advertised deadlines.

People find a seat which the system shows is available... till someone gets on waving their phone to show they booked the seat just ten minutes before getting on. People who are not strong on technology, and some elder people get very distressed and humiliated.  Taking out carriages en route causes the most distress.  This is not a one off or emergency... it’s routine for this company.  It’s hot and overcrowded and the refreshments trolley can’t get to us, or us to them.  After being moved from what I thought was an available seat twice I am on the floor. People stepping over me... have had two knocks on my arm, one on my head and countless trampled toes.

Still we got there and had a great holiday, until our return journey our train was delayed and slow and overcrowded (wifi was non existent) and we got home late. so we complained and in all honesty they did refund £82 of our £110 so while I cannot complain about that they need to either add more carriages sell less tickets or generally get their sh@t together and give the public a service they cannot complain about	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

2019-09-26T18:00:09Z	Crosscountry Train Chaos!	I had purchased several months in advance 2 return adult tickets for a journey to Edinburgh and back from my hometown as we were attending an event. A week or so before the trip I received an email stating that due to engineering works, coupled with industrial action there would be a disruption to services and some cancelled trains. On the day of the outbound trip the train that I had tickets for did actually run, however, due to the volume of passengers already on board by the time it reached my station we were refused entry due to overcrowding and safety concerns, we were informed by station staff that we could get the next due train albeit a longer journey,  however, this train was also full and we were refused entry. We then were told that the only other option left to us was to use another rail company ScotRail and pay for tickets at a much higher cost! The Crosscountry Train official website stated that we could indeed use our tickets with ScotRail as an alternative but this clearly was incorrect as we were told by 3 different staff members that the tickets already purchased would definitely be refused and our only option was to purchase new much more expensive ones, because we had to attend an event I had no other option to buy these tickets and we only made the event by the skin of our teeth! The exact same thing happened the following day with our return trip again I had to purchase much more expensive tickets just to get back home. I understand that engineering works and strike action may not be the company's fault but they do however have a duty of care to their customers. When I called the so called customer service line the person I spoke with was not interested in what I was trying to explain to him about the information being clearly misleading and wrong, the organisation was horrendous and customers treated with contempt! I will never use this company again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

But forget that - I DM'd and emailed XC and they were very apologetic that the First Class experience didn't meet my expectations. So no reason to be frustrated - they didn't have the greatest day 2 days before. Plus my ticket was only nearly £15 with my railcard and I got a seat.Since August 2017, I've had extremely reliable journeys with XC (my local station for XC services is Oxford) - the Voyagers have been virtually on time / no more than around say 5 minutes late, reliable seat reservations and a good trolley service. Plus I always choose the Newcastle services where possible as these are normally great for seat availability. The 14:13 on weekdays (or 14:09 if retimed) is my favourite Oxford to Birmingham New Street train for seat availability, put it that way!Turning to the HST's again - if for any reason you can't afford First Class fares for the CrossCountry HST services then make sure you book a seat in the Quiet Coach! I did this for the 16:03 from Birmingham New Street to Leeds on the 04/04/19 - if you don't want look at a carriage full of passengers, go for seat 5 in Coach G as you're at the Guards Van end of the passenger area facing  the door to it. The window table seat facing it, number 3, is a useful one as you don't need to constantly turn round to see if anyone's coming towards you.There's 'Quiet Zone' stickers on I think nearly (or) all windows. You'll find the rules are respected.If you're an HST fan like me, then do the Quiet Coach if you can't afford First Class!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	5

I have been emailing Nomad (the company responsible for WiFi on Cross Country trains) for the last two hours using 4G on my phone, and they seem incapable of getting the WiFi back on. They've also asked some truly idiotic questions - replying to an email listing my arrival and departure stations by asking for my arrival and departure stations, for instance.For someone like me who is reliant on WiFi to work while they travel, this represents a fairly major issue.

2019-08-03T08:23:11Z	Appalling service AVOID!!!	Appalling service! I had purchased a 1st class ticket from Darlington to Aberdeen with LNER yesterday but was informed of substantial delays or possible cancellation by LNER due to line problems near Peterborough and advised I could use Cross Country to complete my journey instead as all ticket restrictions had been lifted because of the circumstances. When I boarded the train I was informed that hot/cold food would be served after Newcastle. However when the food trolley staff arrived I was then informed that Cross Country were not providing food to LNER passengers!! Despite the fact that her trolley was well stocked! I was then left with absolutely no choice but to purchase supplies for my near 6 hour journey from the catering carriage! I was a sitting duck with no other option! At no time prior to boarding the train was I informed that the catering component of my LNER 1st class ticket would not be honoured! Had I been made aware of this prior to boarding I would have been in a position to make an informed choice as to whether to board the train!Thank goodness I had the means to pay for supplies otherwise i would have faced a 6 hour journey without! Thankfully I do not have any serious health problems ie diabetes otherwise the train would have been forced to stop and suffer delays because of a medical emergency! Thank goodness I did not have any small children with me faced with a hungry 6 hour journey! I am a frequent train traveller and having been subject to this appalling customer service yesterday I advise others to avoid ever purchasing tickets with this company, who in my experience are devoid of the human factor favouring strict profit margins rather than assisting customers in need! Appalling! Avoid using this train operator at all costs!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

Only train company I've used that has reserved seating outside of 1st class, but other companies manage to avoid this and still have plenty of seating most of the time. These trains are usually overloaded, even on journeys that don't have that many people. Perhaps one day the company bosses will invest some money in extra carriages instead of extra pay for themselves, but I doubt it. Other countries manage to have perfectly serviceable nationalised railways, why is it we always have to come up with excuses? Probably because some of that extra pay goes into the pockets of politicians and media moguls.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

Any service worth its salt would have offered us something from the drinks trolley for standard fares. I will do anything to avoid traveling with this company again,	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1
2019-06-09T14:32:30Z	I my sister recently travelled from…	My sister recently travelled from Derby to Plymouth on a disabled rail pass, on her arrival at Derby station she requested assistance and a member of your team took her luggage escorted and heplped her locate her seat, put away her luggage in the racking and informed Plymouth she would require some assistance on arrival. On her return journey again your staff help her even racing across the station with the luggage (as she was running a little late) to make sure she caught her pre booked train. As this was her first long distance journey alone since becoming disabled, it has given her the confidence to get out and about more and for that we cannot thank you enough.

2019-06-09T14:32:30Z	Awful	Sat with a pillar at my shoulder on an otherwise cramped, uncomfortable train from Bristol to Leeds. Virtually zero luggage space, nowhere to charge your phone and Wi-fi is a joke. Food/drink service abandoned because the aisles are full of standing passengers. First time and last time I’ll ever use this service, for which I paid almost £300 for the privilege.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1
2019-06-09T14:32:30Z	Outrageous!	Booked a trip to Birmingham and back to Bournemouth, a 3 hours travel time (at least). The amazing suprise came in play once we arrived in  Birmingham station where we were supposed to get on the 16:04 train, but the amazing part was the moment we've come to realise that the train was about to leave and it was packed, and we were not able to get in the train!!! We have paid for the tickets £200 and we expected to at least have the luxury of getting on the actual train, which of course did not happen! We waited 1 hour for the next one (1 hour for which we felt lucky as we might have had the possibility of actaully not having another train). We have indeed managed to get ourselves in the next train and we received the compensation of having to sit on no seat what so ever for 3 hours!!!! This is beyond normal, and I should have expected to at least have where to sit for 3 hours ride! Since when a train has the option of standing on your feet for a ride??	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1
2019-06-09T14:32:30Z	Currently sat on the floor	Currently sat on the floor, having bought a ticket this morning to travel between Taunton and Exeter, paid the same as somebody with a seat, this is not an unusual experience, yes the trains will be busier on a bank holiday weekend, put more carriages on or stop selling tickets at the same price as a seat.Cross Country trains are a joke, always overfull, uncomfortable even if you manage to get a seat, rude staff or non existence staff	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1
2019-06-09T14:32:30Z	Just no	Overcrowded, unreliable and expensive like every other train company. However, the thing that really sets Crosscountry apart is their jobsworth guards/paramilitary. Don't sit in a seat that isn't assigned to you, don't stand no matter how busy it is, don't even look in the general direction of first class with a standard class ticket and don't dare try and travel on a group saver ticket. If you avoid these things, maybe you won't incur their wrath...maybe. This company is so bad they make South Western Railway seem good.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1
2019-06-09T14:32:30Z	Ridiculous ticket delivery system	Ticket delivery system is a complete farce instead of just issuing you a ticket to your email like Virgin trains you have to register online with them and then download their app, even after all that you can only  download your ticket on the day of travel, I don't know why it's such a secret, it's a train ticket not a nuclear missile code, I'm sure I speak for most people when I say I've got more important things to do on my day of travel than spending time logging onto apps and downloading tickets.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

How can you sell more tickets than seats available? And why is there only 1 toilet working (which I happen to be stood next too and it stinks!) my feet are killing so thought i’d Review your services as I’m so disappointed. Normally I’ve always experienced good train journeys but my surprise weekend away saw my outgoing train cancelled too, so all in all completely disheartened with our rail network. Thankfully only two more stops for me on this crowded service even the refreshments trolley can’t make i through😡	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

I reserved a seat with CC in 2nd class but the train time clashed with the Cheltenham races so was told to stand in first class. After Cheltenham I tried go to my coach and was asked why I was in first class !! On the way back home told a  train crew member that someone was sat in my reserved seat he said okay and walked off. Then when I tackled the gentleman in question he made so many excuses about moving that a chap opposite offered me a seat as he was getting off soon	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1
2019-06-09T14:32:30Z	The worst	I am a fairly frquent traveller on Virgin, East Midlands, London North Western, GWR and Cross country. Cross Country by some way are the worst, mainly due to overcrowding.  Their franchise documents promise a great deal - more trains and carriages.  Too bad they never deliver.  I used to travel trouble free on London Midland yet they had the franchise taken off them.  If I'm waiting for a Cross Country train I always look in envy at those on a Virgin train.  The former operate 4 carriages (one of which is first class) whilst the latter offer 9 or 11.  On the odd occasion that Virgin 2nd class is full I have been allowed to move to First Class.  Must check when Cross Country's franchise is due for renewal to see what they're promising with no intention of delivering!!  To add insult to injury CrossCountry even have the cheek to charge you for postal delivery of ticket AND unbelievably also charge for collection from a ticket machine.  I therefore buy my Cross Country tickets, when I have no choice but to travel with them, from Transpennine who do not charge either for postal or ticket machine collection.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1
2019-06-09T14:32:30Z	Horrific.	Horrific.Over the last 12 months I have witnessed a window shatter next to an elderly gent sat behind me and a person faint in between carriages because there was hardly any room to breathe.They provide 4 carriages (one of which being 1st class!) for peak time hours when people use the train to go to and from work.Just this week they decided its also time to bump the prices up by £5!!!Total rip off. Most of the company's staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. There are a few individuals that are good at their jobs but unfortunately there aren't enough to level out the bad.Worst company I have ever had the nightmare to give my money to.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1
2019-03-08T13:14:46Z	Terrible!	Every time I have to travel using CrossCountry it just ruins my day. Overcrowded, sometimes you can also see carpet moths flying in the compartments.

Travelled 1st class to Cheltenham Spa from  Newcastle...one cup.of coffee a packet if crisps and a packet of biscuits. No alcohol offers, no more hot drinks available!

I was not allowed to board the train as it was full !!!What is the point in booking a train and a seat?I then had to explain to two different train guards why I was on a later train than booked as they eagerly pointed out I was on the wrong train.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1
2019-03-08T13:14:46Z	Awful	Trains are always over packed, always left sweltering in the vestibule only to get shoved out the way by a food trolley.

Usual experience with Cramped, filthy and late trains, no space, hard seats, noise and vibration is awful from engines under the carriage. Rude staff, high prices. This time coupled with a blocked toilet and another toilet that made the whole carriage smell like a sewer. Train just idles at Birmingham  for 25 mins without explanation despite already running 12 mins late. Noone cares! No offer or sign of any refreshments from Sheffield to Banbury. Truly unacceptable, cannot believe they charge you £142 return for these nightmare journeys,  they should pay you to edure it! As trains already rammed who cares I guess as they make there money anyway...people should boycott but little option to do so, they've got you!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1
2019-03-08T13:14:46Z	Highest fares when service is worst	These four-coach trains just don't have the capacity to cope at busy times. Not helped by passengers who leave the remains of their half-eaten food on the tables. Ironically at busy times the fares are also the highest. If you're lucky enough to travel at quiet periods it's quite pleasant.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	3

When train manager was asked what was going on and how a journey can be cancelled half way through - he was indignant and of an attitude this was normal and didn’t understand whybinjadvan issue.Shocking for a transport and customer service provider .

2019-03-08T13:14:46Z	Absolutely Awful	I usually travel with Virgin. Booked first class from Stoke on Trent to Winchester on Cross Country.  Let me tell you Virgin this is not. I can't believe there is such a difference in standards. The journey was over three hours and the carriage was freezing. The staff were offhand and despite the fact that there were only about half a dozen people in the first class carriage, I had to show my ticket after each stop - really annoying when one is trying to concentrate on something! I was offered a cup of lukewarm coffee in a cardboard cup but had to ask about food which they advertise as serving. I was eventually reluctantly offered a packet of crisps. The cost was over twice as much as going by Virgin to London and the overall experience far less than half as good. Give me Virgin any day!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

This is not a one off this is every day! There’s less crowded tube trains in London than this. The reviews say it all trains are always overbooked and horrific. Clearly taking heed of all their feedback.Sadly they have the upper hand because their rubbish trains are the only ones you can get to get to work. They don’t put extra carriages on and if you do manage to get a reserved seat on that rare occasion good luck getting the ignorant people who sit in reserved seats.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

2019-03-08T13:14:46Z	"The ""Complementary"" Upgrade Scam"	"The ""Complementary"" Upgrade ScamDid you know that CrossCountry Trains believe that because they mark everything in the Upgrades as ""Complimentary"" they believe they are not obliged to provide the service, even though they are happy to charge you 3 or 4 times the Standard fare for it? Well, you do now. I booked well in Advance for the service which was a 4-hour service from Manchester to Bristol. The rest of the train was full so I didn't want to fight my way through drunken football fans so waited for the table service. Nobody came, and then 5 mins before I was due to get off the train someone came and offered me a cup of tea - how nice. I was so glad I paid the extra for 3.5 hours of nothing and then a cup of tea I'd have to down like a shot of Tequila. When I complained, I was then informed that none of the services that I paid for were guaranteed and all were subject to availability. They also said that I should have gone to the train manager to ask for my complimentary food and drinks, thus then blaming me for not receiving the service I paid them to provide while moaning about short staffing as if I had done the rota for them.Basically, you can take an old Virgin Train and keep the first class badges on them as much as you want, but if you don't care about the customers who pay you the service will always be abysmal."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

2018-12-09T14:13:26Z	After traveling on Cross Country Trains…	After traveling on Cross Country Trains on 7th November from Birmingham New Street to Manchester Piccadilly and paying £19.00 for my ticket, I find that they do not adhere to there policies. My train was delay by 27 minutes and I did a breakdown to the two people I spoke to.  In other words they don't know how to add up ie if it takes 10min from Maccelsfield to stockport and then 10min to Manchester in total that is 27min. The attendant on the train said that the train was delayed my 30min and that you can claim a refund. That is totally a lie because they refuse to give you a refund. The two people in which I spoke to was Rav and Prianca they had no clue what they was talking about and there customer service skills were below average. They make money out of the general public and vulnerable people and refuse to give them a full refund, I think CROSS COUNTRY TRAINS should be ashamed of themselves in what they are doing to people.  If they was the last train company on earth I definitely would not use them. They have no sympathy to there clients whatsoever and treat them like scum.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

2018-12-09T14:13:26Z	Did a return to Birmingham New Street…	Did a return to Birmingham New Street from Reading on the weekend of the 23rd/24th November. My tickets were booked through the Trainline App.Upon getting on at Reading, it was quickly apparent that even though The Trainline said I had a reserved seat, there were no actual reservations on the train itself. This lead to a free for all and some raised voices and arguments amongst passengers. It was also quickly apparent that there were way more passengers than coaches; there were only 4 coaches and there were about a dozen or more passengers standing in each carriage. At each stop after Reading, the amount of Passengers getting onto the train far exceeded the amount getting off. When we arrived at Birmingham, it was fair to say the Train was rammed.Sadly, it was more or less the same scenario on the return journey on the Sunday, but I will add that both journeys were more or less on time and the trains had ticket guards, who were pretty good dealing with the customers. They were probably used to the situation. So going forward, the answer to the problem is pretty simple, put on 1 or 2 more coaches per train.And lastly, YOU DO NOT CHARGE FOR THE INTERNET IN 2018. Lots of signs everywhere saying there is wifi, only to try and log in and find out they charge. What an utter p*** take.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

It's sickening that people have to pay full price to stand up, cramped between other smelly sweaty people for hours on end.

2018-12-09T14:13:26Z	Avoid First Class!	Well.....getting on at York to Edinburgh first class, I was greeted by a lady doing the trolley who exclaimed loudly and in a shrill manner  'THIS IS FIRST CLASS'. People looked around and I went 'Yes, I know thanks' (clearly I mustn't have looked the part!!).Then she immediately came to check tickets, before offering food declaring 'there is only tuna or egg left'.  We said OK we'll have those, then!Then it was 'I can't serve you alcohol'. Ok, so we walked the length of the train twice but couldn't find the trolley man. I wanted something to celebrate some good news, but I gave up as it was just too much hassle!Oh, and the train carriage  was cold...i discovered the window on the top part of the nearest door was open... as an aside i was amused to see it was an old train where you need to put your hand out to the handle to open the door ..:)	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

2018-08-31T15:46:18Z	Train Manager Chris does not care about passengers	Travelled with this company on 9th August 2018, travelling from Reading to Southampton. I was with my daughter and young son with luggage. Had to sit on floor outside the toilet while the 4 or 5 cross country train staff sat in luxury in the otherwise empty first class carriage.I spoke to the extremely unhelpful train manager called Chris. Quite possibly the rudest and most unhelpful person I have ever had the pleasure to meet. He couldn’t care less that there was a young child sat outside the toilets. Chris even said that passengers are not his responsibility, unbelievable.!!I have emailed a formal complaint to CEO Andy Cooper, and had no response from him or the company. Absolutely shocking.The government needs to step in and stop this company operating.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

I travelled from Markinch to Durham. The trolley service starts in Edinburgh and I was so hungry by the time I arrived at Durham. When I asked the crew why I had not been offered food they said at weekends it is a hit or a miss whether first class receives a buffet service. What the heck did I pay extra for? First time using Cross Country first class and definately the last. Utter waste of my hard earned money. AVOID !!!

2018-08-31T15:46:18Z	Not if I have a choice	I'm a regular commuter from Newcastle to Edinburgh and I usually travel on an Advance First Class ticket. I usually use the Virgin/LNER service which almost always provides me with a good experience. Unfortunately, due to timings I have this week needed to arrive slightly earlier which necessitated using the Cross Country Service.I would not recommend it to my worst enemy; as a 1st Class service it is diabolical.LNER breakfast tea served in a china cup with a teaspoon - Cross Country breakfast tea served in a disposable cup with wooden stickLNER breakfast option includes a Full English breakfast - Cross Country offers a bacon roll warmed up in the microwaveAnd the WiFi wasn't working this morning. . . and to cap it all the Cross Country service is more expensive	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	2
2018-08-31T15:46:18Z	On average Ok, Customer Service bad	I have been using crosscountry frequently as I have travelled the UK quite extensively over the last couple of months. I Was inclined to give the company a one star rating based on my experience today, however that would not be a representative rating of my overall experience. I’ve had my fair share of delays with them, but I’ve also had a lot of delays with other companies. I find it weird that in 2018 you are still expected to pay for WiFi on a train, but other companies charge, too. What I however don’t understand at all is their system of making you take the train you booked for your advance ticket even if said train is massively late. Both the earlier train and my train were so late, I could have easily taken the earlier train, making me a Happy customer arriving slightly ahead of scheduled time. Instead I was told I would have to wait another hour for my delayed booked train to arrive, making me a very late unhappy customer eligable for a refund. I have travelled several countries by train and crosscountry Is the only train company I’ve come across that doesn’t seem to understand that if you are not delivering your promise (aka arriving at the planned stop at the planned time)   Good customer service can really smooth things over with your unhappy customers. Delays happen and can’t always be prevented, bad customer service however is a choice.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	3

Sent via royal mail special delivery at own cost with a hand typed cover letter (yes believe it or not this is the process apparently). Tickets arrived 14/6 for which I have proof. 3 phone calls later, each time having to explain the whole thing again, and 4 weeks later I still haven't received a refund. Each time I call I am promised that the refund is being processed, with the excuse that some error has been made somewhere along the way. This is 2018. There is absolutely no excuse for a large company such as Crosscountry to not have a robust and automated returns procedure and to be instead forcing customers to write letters - with no means of tracking the refund process. In addition, it seems there is no cohesion in dealing with complains and no process or system in place to track and progress problems or complains with customer experiences.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1
2018-08-31T15:46:18Z	Very poor service	Cancel trains with no explanation, always late, always overcrowded, no logic to the number of carriages allocated to services. A busy service will have 2 carriages while a quiet one has 5 almost empty carriages. Bizarre, considering the numbers don't tally between morning and evening trains. Do cross country trains think a smaller number of commuters return home? Well, the clue is in the word 'commuter'...	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

2018-08-31T15:46:18Z	Don’t waste your money.  Cross Country 1st Class is a Farce 😡	Don’t bother booking 1st Class with this company.  I was travelling from York to Birmingham New Street and boarded at 12.45pm for a two and a half hour journey.  I’m 71 and was travelling with my 7 year old grandson.  We hadn’t bought anything to eat as complimentary refreshments are normally part of the deal, even if it’s just a sandwich.  I normally travel with Virgin and the service is reliable. Firstly it was an hour before anyone arrived with the trolley ie 13.45.   By now most of the carriage was grumbling and hungry.  We hadn’t eaten since breakfast at 7.30 am.  There was NO FOOD. We were offered biscuits or a piece of fruit cake.  When a passenger complained that more was promised on the leaflet she was reading, she was told rudely to ‘read the small print’.  However we were willing to buy food but that wasn’t an option either.  There was no food. Some passengers were travelling on to Bristol and an elderly couple, one a type 2 diabetic, were travelling to Penzance on this train; a journey of 8+ hours. My advice ...travel standard class, take your own food or better still use a better train company.Oh...and don’t bother complaining you won’t even get a response.

After 3 weeks when there wasn't any sign of refund i contacted them and was told i need to send the ticket back to get the refund ( was not mentioned at all to begin with) again in 5 working days. I sent the ticket  (luckily) by recorded delivery. After 2 weeks again no sign of refund. Upon contact they denied to receive any ticket but when i chased up the recorded delivery reference they admitted they had recieved it the next day i sent the ticket.

I contacted their call centre in India, the call handler couldn't understand a word I said nor I him. Eventually I had to go to the ticket office and was asked to pay £30 more for the exact same journey so that I could use my voucher. Needless to say I didn't bother.

It was almost double the price to book from Doncaster to Birmingham international so I booked this instead as it was the same train (which just shows how they manipulate prices from busier destinations). This train was cancelled on very little notice, maybe 5-10 minutes at the most. I was forced to book a taxi to reach the airport in time for my flight. I then sent an email to there team which took well over 2 weeks to get a response. I was told I was not eligible to claim any expenses on the taxi I had to pay for and also I had to post my ticket back for the train that never even departed to get my money back. I told them why do I need to do this, clearly their system should automatically credit customers their money back for cancelled journeys, instead of wasting their time in the hope they will not send the ticket back. Will defiantly avoid them in the future.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

2018-04-02T21:52:18Z	Shockingly bad	Truly appalling service.  Bought a ticket for my partially sighted father on the understanding that he would only have to change trains once during his journey; a change that we clued him up for and he was happy about.  The price of the ticket was truly extortionate but we felt we had put him in a position of safety.  On the day, due to industrial action which we were not notified of, he ended up being shunted from train to train making a total of four changes and never actually reaching his final destination as we picked up a station before to save him the stress of yet another change.  He was almost three hours late on the original arrival schedule and Cross Country are refusing to refund the cost of the ticket because he neglected to keep track of what times he got onto the various trains he was forced to use.  He was just intent on getting home in one piece. Taking notes of times was not part of his plan for the day, he just went where he was told to go in a state of confusion and panic that robbed him of his dignity.  The lack of humanity and decency displayed by Cross Country trains is abhorrent.  Don't use them.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1
2018-04-02T21:52:18Z	Truly dreadful trains at vastly inflated prices	Took the 18.15 from Reading to Macclesfield once a week every week last year. Nearly 3 hours to travel 170 miles.  Only once tried standard class - utterly vile.  Scrum to get on.  Old small seats so packed up against other people with nowhere to put a suitcase.   Had to upgrade (at my own not employer expense) to first class just to get a seat.  Too few carriages resulting in appalling inhumane overcrowding.  People pressed against the glass like flies, and sitting/standing in every available inch of toilets, carriages and corridors.  Surprisingly little abuse from  passengers - in France there'd be riots if people were treated this badly.  Grotty trolley clatters eventually through in first class and had to pay for 'dinner' in the form of the measly overpriced cheese & pickle sandwich, crisps and warm wine or warm beer.  (Eventually cracked and now travel from Slough to Paddington across London to get to Euston for a 'proper' Virgin train home.  Not much better but less stressful).   Typical CrossCountry first class booked online in advance ticket price: around £250 return.  Shocker.  Avoid.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

When making cross country aware of this on their Twitter feed their response is always ""get the later train"". Which is either an hour after or has multiple changes. Constantly dismissive about the plight of their passengers, condescending, arrogant and unrealistic. When questioning why they cannot simply put more carriages on the responses have been ""we do not have anymore carriages and save these for busier services"" and I have even been told ""they are not making anymore carriages in this country at the moment""I have done this journey every day for over a year and I can count on one hand the number of times I have been able to sit down. The train managers have even started to make jokes about the trolley Not being able to get through, yet none of them seem to have the ambition to do anything about it. I have a pinched nerve in my neck and standing up every day is really aggravating this, to the point where I am seriously considering taking  a pay cut and quitting my job.

2018-04-02T21:52:18Z	Company Unwilling to Refund After Spelling Mistake on Print at Home Ticket	I recently bought a print at home ticket over the telephone and on opening the PDF ticket I noticed that my name was misspelled. The ticket clearly states that ID must be presented with it in order for it to be valid and consequently I contacted their customer service team who explained that they were unable to amend the mistake and that the situation now needed to be investigated before a refund could be issued. I was advised to buy another ticket to allow me to travel and I followed this advice.I continued to follow up this problem with their customer services department who acknowledged that the mistake was theirs and that I was wrongly advised to buy another ticket, (instead I should have been issued a permit to travel which would have allowed me to travel on the original ticket)Cross Country Trains were unable to refund me as they claimed that proof of purchase for the extra ticket was required to do so, despite the situation being a mistake on the original ticket which caused it to be invalid. I had no such proof of purchase as the extra ticket was not returned when used at the ticket barrier at my destination station.I continued to dispute this situation and was offered only travel vouchers as compensation but, not likely to be travelling by Cross Country Trains in the near future, I continued to seek a full refund. This was never offered and I gave up on the situation approximately £52 out of pocket.Cross Country's response was certainly unreasonable. They agreed that the mistakes that led to the expense were theirs and that a refund was not immediately issued for the invalid ticket is baffling. It is regrettable that I did not have the original ticket but this was no fault of my own and in any case is irrelevant as the situation was entirely a problem with the unusable original ticket. All in all, it is very disappointing that such a well established company is not prepared to immediately refund its customers for mistakes that they make.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

When I asked the guard 'what makes this first class service' he replied 'lucky you didnt pay full first class price' and laughed.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1
2020-11-09T05:45:33Z	Draconian tactics	"Well what can I say. Missed train due to a road closure with no diversions in place, asked for a credit note as I use trains frequently and was basically told that because of the Corona virus they had been told to ""play it by the book"" and had it not been during the pandemic they may have done something. Very classy cross country keep up the good work. And please enjoy my £42.50 to which I received no value. Maybe it can go to your Christmas party.

2020-11-09T05:45:33Z	Almost always a great service, and when it is not, they apologise & put things right!	Along with Virgin, CrossCountry is my favourite train Company. If I could choose, I would always use their trains & services. They are almost never late, and if they are, they have the decency to apologise (are your reading this Northern???), find you an alternative and give you the money back, should you qualify for a reimbursement. Finally, their App is spot on, and they were very supportive & informative during the first phase of the Covid, and still are. Thank you guys!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	4

All reports of my work had been excellent from train managers to rsm's to catering supervisors until a new csm came along as a graduate from uni. She did not like that I speake as is and was not happy with my work,she was always looking over your shoulder every 5 seconds and checking your work. You can not work under those conditions. She check my work one morning and found a couple of bits of rubbish in the bins,she was not happy I had not done as she had ""instructed"" also I changed setts a station to early that she had instructed. She had a informal meeting in between my 20 minutes of break, so I had no break.  The up shot of conversation was my employment was terminated. Yet all reports of my work was excellent. Way da go x-country for treating your workers that risked theire life for others.

No problems with LNER , however Crosscountry keep coming up with things so that a refund cannot be obtained . Worst train company ever , I’ve been stuck at Stansted , Peterborough and Cambridge previously when they cancel trains with a minutes notice .

2020-11-09T05:45:33Z	Horrible attitude of the train manager	Horrible attitude! After paying a little fortune for a train ticket, I was asked twice by staff to move my seat, because of Covid rules. They actually made me sit closer to the other passengers, breaking the social distancing rules.When I expressed my opinion about ridiculousness of the situation to the train manager, he said, that if I find it ridiculous I shouldn’t be using a public transport and I can feel free to jump off the train at the nearest station. He acted like he was deliberately trying to provoke a conflict. I wasn’t aggressive of offensive in any way, so I don’t think I deserved to be treated like a yob, like the Cross Country staff was doing me a favour letting me using their service. The train manager was extremely rude and offensive and I never experienced this kind of behaviour before. Very disappointing.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1
2020-11-09T05:45:33Z	Rip off!	Booked first class to go up to Edinburgh and I have to say I was so disappointed. The seats, carpet, and tables were tatty. No one even came round with any refreshments. Now you would think despite social distancing that they would have given us a least a bottle of water? but no. I think I'll stick to standard if this is the best Crosscountrycan do. And people wonder why Britain's railways are seen as inferior compared with continental Europe.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1
2020-11-09T05:45:33Z	Disappointing	I bought a first class ticket and didn’t buy food or water for the journey. I knew there wasn’t service in the carriage but I was told passengers would get a complimentary pack from the snack bar. I went to collect my ‘pack’ and it consisted of a cup of tea and a tiny Genoa slice. Given my journey spanned the lunch period I thought I’d get a sandwich at least and a bottle of water. I contacted them via twitter and they just said ‘thanks for the feedback’. I paid £150 for the ticket! Absolutely appalling. Virgin used to provide free water in first class, free drinks and even on weekends you got a proper snack box. They’re just using covid as an excuse.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	2
2020-11-09T05:45:33Z	Terrible Customer Service - No Covid Refunds	I was unable to use the train tickets I'd purchased due to being in an area which had been put on local lockdown. I had only purchased them the day before. All other trains I had booked with other train services for the same week gave me a full refund apart from Cross Country Trains who refused. They said that I should book new tickets which have to be from the same train station that I had previously booked from and the ticket price needed to be the same or higher and that this would be my 'refund'. That is not a refund, that's just poor customer service. It shows a willingness to allow people to travel who shouldn't be, putting others in danger. Will not be booking with or traveling with Cross Country again unless they can rectify this.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

2020-11-09T05:45:33Z	Very poor service	Very poor customer service, recently travelled 1st class from Manchester to Bournemouth, before we travelled (6.7.20) there was nothing on website about lack of refreshments but did have menus for 1st class food and a map showing that our route had catering service. Due to this we didn't take any food and drink. When we boarded we were told that there was no catering at all! Not even water, we had a 4 hour 45min trip with nothing!Customer service not interested and do not accept they have a duty of care to their customers. Having, at very least, water should be available, especially for passengers travelling such a distance. There is now a limited service available but on our return this was available at the other end of the train from 1st class.We have been offered £30 in vouchers, against a £235 each ticket (£470 total). Told them it was an insult but not interested, a bit like the rude staff on the train.Will never travel with them again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

2020-11-09T05:45:33Z	Extremely dissatisfied with the service…	"Extremely dissatisfied with the service and their customer care. I have booked a season ticket and with the booking confirmation, they have shared a customer care number. I was waiting for more than 1 hour 15 min for talking with a customer care representative and after that time, one lady(Ms Churni Khasnobis) picked up the call.I have two points: 1. I have requested for a partial cancellation on 05 Mar to my booking from Leicester to Chesterfield which was planned on 06 Mar over a telephone. The representative confirmed my cancellation. Even after so many days they haven't processed my refund. I came to know today that the payment was rejected as I have activated my ticket before cancelling it. As far I know in UK you can't activate a ticket before the travel day. So I think technically it is not possible. Finally after lot of discussion she has connected me to her manager who has verbally confirmed me that she will be reprocessing my cancellation. I am not sure what will happen next.Point 2: I had to request cancelling my current season ticket for rest of the days as my Office is not allowing working from office anymore due to current situation. The number I dialled as I have received with my season ticket booking from Cross country. Now she has provided me with another no: 03445561344 and told me that this is the number for season ticket department. The question here is if they are not suppose to answer for season tickets then why a other department numbers were given for contacting further on season ticket and harassing and wasting customers time?Do you think that after waiting for more than 1 and half hour, you will l just answer with a alternative phone number and will say ""sorry for the inconvenience caused"" is sufficient for the customer?I am highly dissatisfied with cross-country and will definitely not going to use it for any of my future bookings."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.buytickets.crosscountrytrains.co.uk	1

So if you want to exchange a ticket time - you have to book the revised times - then yourself e-mail an address asking for a refund for the other. And they still charge you £10! Basically, you do all the work - but still pay them £10 for admin!! First person I spoke to said I can exchange over the phone, the second said I couldn't! The first person sent me the tickets in the post, the second said she couldn't! And that for my refund I have to physically go the relevant station (25 mins from my home) - collect the tickets then send a specific e-mail for a refund!!

2020-11-04T00:30:03Z	The decline in Chiltern Railways since Arriva took over	Chiltern Railways was Five ⭐️ Stars for many years, an independent dynamic company constantly improving its services. New stations at Aylesbury and Oxford Parkway were carefully planned and opened.Then the mediocrity of big useless, cost cutting, minimal investment, ingrained poor service that is Arriva took over. The start in the decline was immediate and is now accelerating. Shorter, badly maintained trains, less staff, less training, the cheerful buzz has gone from the customer service.

2020-11-04T00:30:03Z	Today’s experience. Price going up service down rapidly	Today’s experience...Bicester Village Station is my local station which serves Bicester and the local rural community of which I am. I turned up again today to catch a train just before 11:30 and once again NO WHERE TO PARK. The station was never ever built with enough parking and is there only to serve the Chinese/Japanese Bicester Village visitors.  If you are not one of the 7 - 7:30 London commute crowd you can’t hardly ever park. The impact if you want to go to Oxford is that you then drive, Oxford if you know are clearly trying to keep car pollution away. Anyhow not being able to park I then went to Bicester North to get my London train. After fitting traffic I arrived parked and went to get a ticket for travel and parking. As the train I wanted arrived I went to the empty ticket desk to get the tickets as I thought it would be quicker than the machines, wrong, I was told I can only get the parking ticket from the machines. I chose a machine which is touch sensitive, I tapped next customer, tapped again and again and again, absolutely nothing. I waited for the adjacent machine and guess what the train went. Eventually got tickets and and additional wait for over 30mins that I shouldn’t have had. So all in all the 10 minute drive into Bicester to catch a train on time turned into over and hour event.To add insult to injury Chiltern railways have put up all there prices (Arrivia) but facilities and service isn’t going the same direction at the same pace, even though they have put notices up saying the price increases are for investment in better services. They are also changing off peak reduction times in there favour to create a bigger peak time window.  I suspect the senior managers, board of directors and share holders wages, bonuses and returns on investment don’t suffer the same lack of progression.Chiltern railways have known about Bicester Village parking issues since the Station was opened as it is always a problem.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	1

It was about 23:00 on 27/12/19 and all trains from Paddington had been cancelled due to engineering works, I was in stress mode and running out of time, facing the prospect of being stranded in London for the night.Thanks to her help and speedy assistance with obtaining the correct ticket and platform number I was just able to get the last possible train to Oxford that could connect with a train to Reading.That's what I call service !	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	5

Just after leaving Marylebone, the driver announced that one carriage had smoke in it, but not to worry it was probably just from the engine, due to poor maintenance and that he’d stop unscheduled at Wembley to check. He stopped, checked, we heard no more.Then the lights went out in the front carriage. It was pitch black outside. I alerted the driver through the door into his cabin. He stopped unscheduled again, checked, and continued. The lights went on briefly. The driver announced that the lights and air conditioning in the front carriage would probably go off again, and that he had no headlights! The lights went off. It was pitch black.We arrived at Oxford over 20 minutes late. Shocking customer service from Chiltern Railways! It has really declined since Arriva took it over - lots of cancellations, terrible overcrowding, and now serious maintenance and customer safety issues!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	1

I appreciate that there is maintenance work on tracks some times due to which train service is interrupted. However, on those occasions, they shouldn’t be selling tickets for a journey that will never take off!They are really expecting customers to pick up costs for untraveled journeys?!! Moreover, I had to make an extra journey to submit this claim with original tickets and that also cost me and Chiltern railways still can’t apologise and refund the costs of my original ticket!It’s unbelievable how badly they have treated.

2019-12-28T02:51:36Z	Sudden decline in quality of London- Stratford service	Interested to see so many comments on the sudden decline in quality of service with Chiltern. I have used trains from Marylebone to Birmingham and Stratford regularly for more than twenty years. The Stratford service is suddenly of poor quality: cramped seating and very slow journey times. The Conductor on Saturday was most interested in harassing passengers to pay more money even when their connecting trains were cancelled. Our own train was being delayed so that another delayed Chiltern train could overtake us. No grace or sympathy at all. Is he on commission for onboard sales?He did explain that most of the Club trains have been diverted to the Oxford route. These used to be a major part of what made travelling on this service a pleasure. Perhaps we need competition on the Leamington/Stratford service too: the trains were packed in both directions, so the business is there.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	2
2019-12-28T02:51:36Z	Unbearable experience	As a regular commuter between Warwick Parkway and London Marylebone, I have seen a sudden decline in service, both in delays and in number of overcrowded journeys particularly coming out of London from 4pm onwards.  And with a health and safety hazard of sudden stops and speeding whilst those standing are treading over each other in the gangways and doorways it is a disgraceTo charge £113.50 for this level of service should not be acceptable.  Please get your trains fixed - and fix the air conditioning!  Isn’t it obvious that overcrowding on trains will increase the temperature with people breathing/ coughing over each other.  Horrible experience and someone should be held to account to raise the standard of this terrible service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	1
2019-12-28T02:51:36Z	unbelievably bad- literally unbelievably!	Twice been stranded in high wycombe due to all trains being cancelled, they’ve not communicated so we’ve been left waiting and waiting for 2 hours before they decide it’s not a delay and there are no trains running and they won’t put on replacement buses. I’ve been travelling with them for three months to work, and there are three more occasions train was delayed by an hour so 5 major incidents in 3 months, to add to that every day my train delayed between 10/15 minutes, which on occasion I would understand but everyday. And I do not understand 5 major delays in 3 months on one particular timed train so there must be more on other trains! It’s actually disgusting I wish I never got a years pass I have let everyone know not to use them if they can help it, I laughed at the email for the Christmas service- poor souls who use them to get home for Christmas probably won’t get home!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	1

2019-12-28T02:51:36Z	Chiltern Railways Decline	I've travelled with Chiltern Railways into London for work for many years.  It used to be a really good service, particularly compared to Worst Great Western, which I was previously using.  However, over the past years, I think since it was taken over by Arriva, it's slowly deteriorated - short trains, late trains, over-crowded trains, trains which aren't called until the last minute at Marylebone and Oxford so a whole trainload of passengers trying to get on at the same time.  So in the past week or so - a massive delay on a Friday with a broken down train at High Wycombe, a long delay on Weds last, last night (2nd Dec) the 18,18 nearly  half an hour late - this morning the 07.25 from Oxford Parkway only four carriages due to a train fault - so rammed.  All for the princely sum of nearly £6k a year???!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	2
2019-12-28T02:51:36Z	Avoid if you have a choice.	Travel both for work and leisure into London. Ageing and frequently short formed and poorly maintained trains that have damaged seats or interior panels hanging off (to a level it damages your clothing or air conditioning fails and pours water on you), insufficient cleaning, poor communication during delays, detached management and customer services, and high fares that cannot possibly be justified given all of the above.Was once abandoned for two hours on a platform during winter after they cancelled our service part way. Provided no available ongoing transport other than to pay for own taxi and no communication on how to get home.Chiltern just seem to be running the clock until the end of the franchise. Avoid if you can.Update on damaged clothing (13/12/19): Chiltern will only deal with the claim if I post them my only coat in the dead of Winter and they refuse any flexibility on this (such as my offer to bring the coat into a station for inspection of the damage). No apology offered, and a complete lack of empathy from customer service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	1

I now refuse to use APCOA car parks, which ultimately means I can no longer use Chiltern railways for my journey, now reverting to my car. Shame for Chiltern as that’s £5k pa lost revenue for them, due to poor choice of parking contractor.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	2

And when you do see a ticket inspector they’re all smiley........and only too happy to issue penalty fares!!!!

2019-10-31T14:55:59Z	Amersham Trains	Trains to and from Amersham are overcrowded every day, with no additional services being scheduled to account for an annually increasing passenger count. Given the high annual cost of season tickets that increase year on year, it is shocking that a proportion of the organisational profit does not get reinvested into additional trains, staffing and line improvements.There is only one single ‘fast’ service each weeknight evening, with the first stop scheduled as Amersham, despite it being a significant commuting hub for Buckinghamshire and the Chilterns. Introduction of an hourly fast running service would be practical and benefit many, however the timetable is never rescheduled to meet the needs of the paying public.The line and trains have not been updated for a significant period of time, and trains are often slow running behind their scheduled arrival times and are frequently late during the evenings.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	1
2019-10-31T14:55:59Z	Awful commuter service	If you're travelling to / from Oxford or Birmingham, it seems that the service is OK, with frequent special offers on tickets because there is competition from other operators on these routes. However if you're travelling on commuter routes, every day is a litany of poor timetabling, broken down trains, high prices, short services and significant overcrowding. The trains don't have the services advertised on Chiltern's website (e.g. they advertise plenty of plugs, but that's only for a minority of train types) and it's clear that there will be no new investment in rolling stock until after 2021 when the franchise expires so things will only continue to go downhill.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	1

The Worst  railway after the TFL.I have moved to Northolt Park about 9 months ago and because of this train line I was late more then 30 times, besides the fact that when they cancel and move the times of the trains as they please on more then half of that time was due to the fact they moved the train hours up by 10 min which counts when you live 10 min away from the station always modifying arrived and departure hours 20 min before on their website or worse the train leave 2 min before, which again make me lose it . It drives me crazy will move from the area just because I hate riding with them. Wifi does not work, and mostly they are trains with 2 carriages.

2019-10-31T14:55:59Z	My railcard expired on the 6th…	My railcard expired on the 6th September. I am a young person travelling on my own. I made an honest mistake by booking a £3.45 ticket using my railcard (16-24 railcard) and not realising that my railcard expired 6 days ago. As I got off at the station there were a line of ticket inspectors waiting and asking for my ticket, I nicely pulled up my ticket and the man asked to see my railcard, I pulled out my railcard and didn’t realise it said it had expired, he asked me when it expired and it was only 6 days ago, I offered to pay the full fare (which was £5) and he said he was going to charge me instead, it was very humiliating and completely unreasonable for such an honest mistake that a loyal customer has made. I’m shocked at how they bullied me into paying their ridiculous fee. Perhaps this isn’t so much to do with railcard but just the unhelpful chiltern railways staff who were very rude and hardly gave me any chance to talk about the money I’ve just wasted on them. I wanted to book another railcard with them but now I’m just going to drive.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	1

The absolute shocker is that the trains have always been on time, I've even been getting to my destinations (Marylebone & Gerrards Cross) early!I was previously subjected to the horrors of having to rely on Southeastern Rail for the commute, that's if they decided on any given day to have an attempt at running a ""train service"".Well done Chiltern, I wasn't aware that commuter trains could actually be a pleasant experience."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	5

The worst train line in and out of London is the Aylesbury to Marylebone line. Shares the track with the met line and constantly timed so it get stuck behind an all stations met line underground train. A gruelling journey, stop start, has way too many speed regulations. All other lines I’ve experienced into London are allowed to travel fast through stations and close to other trains... not this line, you can walk quicker through Harrow on a supposedly “fast” train via Amersham. The journey really does take it out of you. Rubbish trains, older than my grandad, constant shortage of carriages, everyday!! Buy more trains for crying out loud and upgrade them!!

It is slightly slower than the trains from Great Western Railway but:- prices are systematically off-peak, sometimes even super off-peak so it is cheaper- the trains are most of the time pretty modern with plugs to charge your phone, smaller cars and therefore less noise- the WiFi is significantly better than on Great Western Railway- I have never had a late or cancelled train with Chiltern yet it's happened to me several times with Great Western Railway for the same destinations (and I take Chiltern at least twice more often than Great Western Railway)So for cheaper prices, better customer service and better reliability I'd definitely recommend Chiltern over Great Western for London-Oxford even if it's usually about 10min slower.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	4

We then were conducted to the station after this one by another terminating train. First stop was at Denham Golf Club, and then we were conducted to the next one that was Gerrads Cross.By the time we got there, the fastest option to get to Stratford would take 3+ hours and comprise three different trains, implying we would lose our commitment there.Therefore, we decided to go back to London, and even then CR personnel was unhelpful to aid us to get the correct service to Marylebone.Although staff at London Marylebone assured us we would be reimbursed for the tickets and any other expenses incurred in the journey, that's not what happened.Customer service was very slow to respond, and said they would not compensate us for the expenses incurred in the journey, which were caused by the fact that I had a trip planned that did not occur.Furthermore, I had other issues in relation with the missed appointment that I didn't even take into account, although I should.Are you going to do anything?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	1

In addition my local station - High Wycombe - has no parking available after around 0930 (the surrounding public car parks are usually full up as well).  As a result I no longer use this station and avoid Chiltern Railways whenever I can.

CR stance is grossly unfair and amounts to a scam.  If CR lost the receipt for a train they bought does that mean they no longer own it?  Of course not!  This case shows what CR think of their customers - cash cows.  Plan to ensure that their behaviour gets plenty of publicity and costs them a lot, lot more that the replacement ticket.

2019-07-11T09:33:42Z	Don’t be fooled by cheap tickets! Book with Virgin instead!	My first and last journey with Chiltern Railways. Booked advanced tickets from Birmingham to London, had always previously booked with Virgin but Chiltern were irresistibly cheap so I booked with them. Damn should have stayed with Virgin. The train was filthy, so so so filthy. Food on the seats, suspect stains on the tables and this was a morning train - what on Earth went on! Dread to think what an evening train would be like. On the return journey we wanted to catch an earlier train and because we’d booked an advanced ticket we couldn’t do that without paying over £40 per person for a new ticket inc a £10 admin fee. I understand that it’s their policy - it’s a dumb policy as the trains were not full or anywhere near being full and we only wanted the hour earlier train which was in the same price bracket (Super off peak) so personally I don’t know why they couldn’t have just let us on for the sake of just being a good person but that isn’t what annoyed me it was how RUDE the customer service woman was. As soon as we asked to change our tickets she acted like we’d asked for upgrade and a bottle of champagne. She reeled off a bunch of script and shrugged her shoulders as if she doesn’t get paid enough to care. We spent the hour wait having a Nando’s where we received 10x the quality of customer service. I will never be sold by cheap tickets again, it’s not worth it in the end.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	1
2019-07-11T09:33:42Z	Misspelt my email address so could not…	Misspelt my email address so could not validate my chiltern account and get to ticket. Had booking reference  etc so customer service representative, did not give a name, could see my ticket. Apologised for my stupidity and asked for it to be sent to correct email. Unable to do so, would have to send an email to apply for a refund as the the customer service representative could not put in an application for me and I needed to buy a new ticket. I would also be charged a £5 admin fee for this. Guy on the phone sounded exasperated himself when he was explaining it to me. Ticket only cost £20 in the first place. Was quicker just creating a new email with the misspelt address to get the original ticket, validating my account and changing the email myself. With the extra time I saved I wrote this review. Poor and clunky.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	2

I am used to doing this for one person only and when I tried to buy four it didn't really like it and blew me out. When I went back to site, the price had doubled. I decided to phone the number given and was transferred to Nicholas, who was extremely polite, did his job efficiently and thoroughly and I cannot recommend him enough. He not only said that I could have the tickets at the price I saw them, which I presume was still what they were advertised as, but posted them out first class, arrriving the following day.  That's what I call service!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	5

On the day she lost it, she purchased a return ticket and kept copy of receipt but Chiltern refused to refund her the return ticket because she had receipt only. How was she supposed to know that she needed to retain return ticket too?

If you lose a ticket with proof you paid for the service the jobs worths will not see sense and just assume you are a fraudulent vilan . Also stupid website you need to accept a cookie to read their cookie policy. Trains are often double stacked at Marylebone and people get on the wrong one because the announcements do not state this. No idea of customer service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	1
2018-07-24T10:55:00Z	BEWARE - wrong ticket times confirmations sent. not what you selected and confirm ed several times!	BEWARE. selected tickets for my journey for end of June online. Selected times and dates, added to the basket, confirmed, checked the details, confirmed again. redirected- confirmed again. Paid. Email confirmation arrived - wrong train times! ..called Chiltern.... guess what... its apparently my fault that i didn't check on the 5th confirmation page that their website changed my tickets times for no reason at all!I run a test with an exactly same set of tickets and its done it again! Their website randomly changes tickets times you selected to random other times before the final step! Then they refused to amend the tickets on the phone despite tickets being amendable on the confirmation. Only amendments i was offered was to buy new tickets or pay £10 admin charge! the actual tickets were only £14 but i am so shocked at the service i had to write and share about this. I actually recorded a video showing what their website doing is their error not mine, but i was told its my fault because i didn't check the 5th confirmation page for the 5th time! who expects the already selected and checked and confirmed and reconfirmed tickets to then randomly be changed for no reason? NOT ME clearly! the company is a joke. i rather walk then travel with them again. i will buy new tickets elsewhere, Chiltern, enjoy the money you have taken for your error!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	1

The ticket office staff at Warwick Parkway are always helpful and friendly. However I seem to think that weekend fares now have much fewer advance purchase bargains. And I do think it was a big mistake for Chiltern to effectively withdraw their service into Stratford / Stratford Parkway which must make RSC theatre visits a real trial for many not living close by - very shortsighted.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/chilternrailways.co.uk	4

2018-07-24T10:55:00Z	'We're not getting there'	So we arrive at Gerrards Cross station in good time for our train to London. Now, whilst this is a sunny Saturday and not a mega busy weekday there are nevertheless quite a few travellers after trains.But as there's only one ticket machine working and two of the automatic barriers out of action there's a bit of a queue building up at the ticket kiosk.Well, one would expect the single station kiosk employee to be rather prompt with the dispensing of tickets so that all could catch the trains they had planned for.Sadly he was far more interested in answering his 'phone and continue to talk for ages whilst everyone else is waiting trying to buy tickets.And did I mention that this is the third time we've witnessed the station ticket person talking on the 'phone, finishing his call before turning to waiting commuters with a look of indignation that says 'I don't really want to bother with giving you a ticket, I'd much rather talk on my 'phone!'.Hello!

They immediately contacted Horsham station (the next train stop for the train I was in) and managed to find my suitcase. The customer support in both stations was impeccable, they helped me a lot.

He shouted really loud at me and threatened me that I will have to give him money now. I felt very threatened. He towered over me and I could feel the spit from his mouth on my face. When I asked to speak with another member of staff who I would be happy to present my ticket to, he threatened to throw me off the train and stamped on my foot really hard. I cannot believe this is taking place. Not to mention the prices are extortionate and unlike any other rail company I’ve ever seen.

I live in Eastbourne and whilst I was studying in London, I have arrived several times late to my classes, presentations or exams. This is just RIDICULOUS! The price of the tickets keeps rising but the quality of your services keeps getting worse and worse! For the price that I'm paying for the tickets, I'm expecting a great service, fast travel, good quality of the trains.....but NO! You just keep rising the prices, oh well....If I could use a different company, believe me that I would definitely use it! Can you please start hearing to your customers??? Please!

Why are they so poor, you ask?Several reasons:- Constant price hikes. The prices to get to London from Eastbourne, even at off peak times, are absolutely ludicrously expensive- Dirty trains and disgusting toilets- Constant cancellations.

When there were community meetings at which a representative for Southern was meant to attend, they were no where to be seen.I've been prompted to write this review since reading about Southern cancelling ALL off-peak trains between London and Brighton, meaning commuters in between each city will have to use Gatwick Express, which is £8.50 more expensive.

Got given a premium number at the station to keep calling them and ended up with a £25 phone bill. Asked to be reimbursed and got given £15 worth of Southern vouchers.

Although I've experienced a couple of cancellations on the way to work, they are otherwise always on time and my monthly pass from W. Norwood to Clapham is great value.

2019-12-27T10:56:34Z	Refund unicorns!!!	I bought two single Gatwick to Brighton on 30th August at one of the counters. The card was taken but a ticket wasn't generated. The man said the machine had stuck, to go to the next counter and come back for a refund. Bought tickets and returned to be told no refund at counter and to contact Customer Services on number given. I did this on September 4th after confirming that both payments had been taken.  Two follow up phone calls and two and a half months later and still waiting. I guess they expect us to give up and go away. How many people have been fleeced by Southern Rail refunds non-service I wonder!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

I think the trains have ran to time 4 times. Countless cancellations mean an enormous scrum to get the next train which is always late. Several times I haven’t been able to get on the packed train. Never more than 3 carriages, had a seat 3 times. If Southern Rail had any competition whatsoever it wouldn’t have lasted more than a couple of weeks. Utterly shocking, amazingly bad.

Used the train to go from Gatwick to Southampton Central but was surprised to find the train had no places for suitcases and prams so had to find seats to put them on which can be a problem if the train is packed. Also had to get off at Havent and use a bus because of works on the line so had to cram on that with all our bags, had to then get the train at fratton to Southampton Central after long waits.

As if it's not bad enough that trains are cancelled with no reason pretty much every day and it's always a surprise whether you will make it to to work or home, the condition of the actual trains is absolutely unacceptable.

2019-10-26T10:26:44Z	Shocking experience	It's been a while since I travelled on Southern and I hope not to have to do it again. I purchased a first class ticket and was very surprised to find that the first class seats were more or less identical to the normal seating. There were only 10 seats in a tiny compartment with nowhere to put cases except in the aisle or high up on a narrow shelf. After the guard had passed by these seats were occupied by passengers who obviously did not have the right ticket. I do not blame them as the second class was packed (on sunday night) and people had to stand. The train was late with dirty old seats, and not enough carriages. Never again (I hope!!). Until the government do something to reduce the prices and improve the service, the public will take their cars if they have one and continue to contribute to pollution.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

It was very difficult moving through the train while it was moving to get to the right carriage. Some aisles were very narrow. Having stopped at Gatwick the 4 carriages to Portsmouth were extremely busy with people standing and cases in the way which made it difficult to get off the train. 4 carriages to Portsmouth was never going to be enough!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	2

Their website does not reflect the true position re delays, cancellations and gross overcrowding. It is usually cheaper to fly to Europe than get a train to London with Southern. Trains and stations are full of litter, vandalised and often the toilets are locked or in a disgusting condition.  They make huge profits from their ‘customers’. They run a compensation scheme which does not work, they either offer tiny amounts of money or refer claimants to British Transport Police under bogus allegations. Nasty company.

I was around 3 hours late arriving in Reading, but luckily just got the last train to Cardiff.The previous time was even worse.  All trains to Cardiff were cancelled because of strike action.

2019-08-26T10:08:03Z	Absolutely f***ing hopeless.	I've been using Southern Rail for about 10 years intermittently, but everyday for the past 2 years to commute to work up in London. It is WITHOUT A DOUBT the most incompetent public transport company in the UK. If Trustpilot gave the option for 0 stars, I guarantee you would see far lower than the already terrible 1.2 out of 5. The services are so frequently cancelled and delayed that I'm amazed Southern have been allowed to continue operating; they waste thousands of hours per day of people's time. Commuting on Southern trains is a perfect way to ensure both the beginnings and ends of your working day are painful, exasperating and utterly ruined. To date, Southern has wasted approximately 500 hours of my time in the last 2 years alone.If you need to be anywhere important at any specific time, Southern Rail is the LEAST reliable way of getting there possible (and that's not just an exaggeration out of anger, look the satisfaction surveys up, or read the numerous other Trustpilot reviews).On top of Southern services never running on time, the trains are filthy, the staff are rude (probably because they're just as fed up as the rest of us are with their employer), whoever controls the air con/heating throughout the year must be just rolling a dice and not using their brain, the 'First Class' sections are just a more expensive way travel in exactly the same amount of comfort as elsewhere on the train and thus only serve to make overcrowding worse.If you are reading this review, please avoid this service at all costs. If you do have the choice, any other method of getting where you're going is absolutely worth it. If you use Southern you will arrive late and you will be fuming when you finally get there. If you HAVE to use them as a connecting train like I do for work, I feel your pain and you are not the only one who is made to miss your next train 50% of the time.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2019-08-26T10:08:03Z	Customer Service par excellence	"Monday 10th June. We wanted to buy a ""Two Together"" railcard and then tickets for two separate journeys - one a day return and the other with a week stay. There was a very long line at Victoria station but eventually we arrived at window 8 where the agent extremely courteously and patiently assisted our needs. Did we have our passports with us? No! We are residents - apparently it's mostly tourists who buy in person - we're aged dinosaurs who use the internet to research and then prefer human interaction. We did have our Freedom Passes (for which we are eternally thankful and grateful!) and so our photos were able to be scanned, copied and pasted on our new Two Together railcard. First transaction accomplished! Then we went to the day return from Waterloo to Southampton. The new system is taking a while to settle down but eventually that transaction was also successfully accomplished and then we went on to the week away; travelling from Paddington to Gloucester ... that took quite a while but our ever patient and extremely helpful agent persevered until, eventually, that was also successful. And so we went on to our afternoon appointment ... on reflection we noted that, while the tickets for the Waterloo - Southapton day return had ""Two Together railcard"" stamped, the tickets for our week in Gloucester didn't. Oo-er! We couldn't return yesterday so travelled out again this morning, Tuesday 11th where again there was a long queue - and, because we wanted to speak to the same agent, wewaited for an additional 30minutes until, eventually we could explain our problem. Again, because of the new system and our problem being so rare - advance tickets are tightly regulated and exchanges - changes - etc are virtually impossible - it took quite a  lot of assistance from team leaders, colleagues etc until we were assured the problem would be resolved as soon as possible (the difference being almost £20 and so we were prepared to persevere - we had time - our trip is in August!) And so we are confident that, in a few days, we will return to Victoria for the amended tickets and refund of the over-pay.We would like to thank Vinod (Vinny) most enthusiastically and sincerely for his supreme professionalism, patience and courtesy in ensuring we achieved what we needed; he went far above and beyond in explanations, assistance and, today, in enabling us to wait in the Customer Service office - where there were seats! - while he endeavoured to resolve the tickets dilemma. We are also extremely grateful for Adam's - and Helen's - assistance; we are aware the time it took Vinod yesterday to accomplish our initial requirements and the additional time today and yet at no time were we rushed. We were treated with courtesy and respect throughout and would unreservedly recommend these superb staff members - with many sincere thanks for treating a couple of ""senior citizens"" with such kindness, courtesy, patience and respect!!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	5

But that’s normal for southern you might say, and I’d be the first to agree with you. However, what has prompted this review is not the shambolic service quality we are so very used to, but today the poor, downtrodden staff, who I normally have the utmost sympathy for, were particularly off colour. They couldn’t tell me anything useful, except that three of them told me “WE DONT USE THE SOUTHERN APP WE USE THE TRAINLINE ONE, I can’t tell you anything that isn’t on there”. Wow. Just wow. So abandoned on a platform, two trains cancelled with no prior warning in the app or on the boards and indirect train opportunities missed as a result and that’s the response?

2019-05-25T12:58:43Z	Timetable joke	Southern have changed the timetable so that it now takes 30 minutes to get from West Norwood to West Croydon so that they don't get charged for running late trains.  This journey should take 15 minutes but now it sits at the stations for up to 10 minutes for no reason other than if it is running late, it will still arrive at the timetabled time.  It is now quicker for me to get the bus even in rush hour.  The buses are crowded because everyone else is on it too so the choice is to get a seat on a train and sit on it forever or get there quicker on a crowded bus.  Sort it out Southern!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

I don't know if it is the worst in Britain as I have heard Northern trains is just as bad. In fact, having used trains in many countries, recently Turkey, Denmark, USA and France I suspect it is amongst the worst in the world. Trains don't turn up, they are late or they break down. Clearly there are systemic faults at the highest levels. When will something be done? When will Government give up on this dreadful provider?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2019-05-25T12:58:43Z	Awful.	I hope Southern Rail go bust then we can all have better sleep. Drain of taxpayers money, cosey contract with the government which basically means even if SouthernRail strike, you still make money....why would you have any incentive to actually run the service? That's why you literally do not give a toss whether the service runs or not, as long as your drivers on a cool 80k a year without weekend working contracts and the fat cats taking millions of the UK taxpayer. Southern have made thier bed with Mr Grayling who also takes a lovely slice of Southern Profits. The whole system is a joke. Always blaming the weather, or the equipment, or the staff, or leaves on the track, or the unions or signal failures, or strikes, investment, or customers but never yourself. None of you at the top of Southern have actually had a proper job, much like the European parliament, most positions filled cause they either married well, or knows some high level government officials. For a government run company, the public should have a vote on who runs this shambles of a brand.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

I'm not even gonna bother to comment on how unreliable your actual train service is, since everyone already knows that. First of all, whoever designed your website is terrible at their job. It handles like it's about 20 years out of date. Why do I get redirected to ""update my preferences"" every time I sign in? Extremely annoying when I'm at the checkout page and then sign in to use my payment method, only to be redirected to another irrelevant page. The old website wasn't great, but the overhaul that happened over the last two years made things worse without any discernible improvements. Next come the ticketing machines located at the actual stations. They are straight up garbage, with an infuriating combination of overly simplistic and confusing (it actually takes effort to pull off that combo). Why is the ticketing system in person so radically different from just doing it online?  Why can I not book return tickets at the station except for journeys that return the same day? Why are some of my debit cards inexplicably ""invalid"" for using to collect tickets, even though you state it doesn't matter which card is used for collection? Why do we still have to type in 10 characters of random gibberish to collect our tickets when we have accounts set up online? Surely there could be some easier, more streamlined way to do this in 2018, instead of waiting for each f***ing person ahead of you to open their email on their phone and type in their booking reference. Why is your booking reference not the same as your confirmation number? Why are there no human beings to help anyone at most of the stations? Over the summer I went to collect over £100 of prepaid tickets from a station and one of the journeys inexplicably didn't print but nobody was around to help me. When I got to Victoria and tried to ask someone there, they told me I was S.O.L. because I should have apparently budgeted an extra 20 minutes to talk to invisible customer service people at Brighton station when the machine didn't work.

My advice to anyone who needs to travel is to avoid southern trains at all costs try buses or other operators guarantee you will arrive before the southern train, we all need to vote with our feet and stop using them wherever we possibly can. Then no revenue and hopefully they will go bust and someone with at least some ounce of management and customer service will take over. I honestly have had so much more than I can take of this company I am seriously considering a solicitor and if there is a way to take them to court as they effectively steal my money and don’t give me what I pay for daily!

Southern charge more and more for a worsening service, and my experience of their customer service has been that they are dishonest and unhelpful. One example was a 45 minute delay to my journey earlier in the year... they refused to honour their pay and delay scheme insisting I had only been 5 minutes late (not true, and the driver himself had confirmed over the speakerphone that we should apply for the scheme due to the appalling journey times). Addiontally their app and online timetables frequently do not match either each other or reality, and that is to say nothing of the appalling lack of cleanliness on the trains and rudeness of the conductors. I thoroughly disapprove of this service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

Every time !! . it is incomprehensible that this shambles still have their franchise , someone somewhere must be getting a big pay off .  They have zero consideration for the pain they put their customers through . I have lost count of the amount of times my train has been delayed or cancelled causing a huge backlog of commuters then when a train finally arrives late with not enough carriages the overcrowding is of biblical proportions and surely extremely dangerous . the amount of times a train has crawled along at walking speed . I could go on and on . people I know from Haywards Heath area have actually either quit their jobs  or moved to avoid using this hideous joke of a train service , yes it's that bad. there are only so many times you can be late for work / meetings . i myself leave an hour early to allow time for their shoddy service but still am regularly late for whatever I have to do .

I use Southern Rail every day to get to work, or not as the case is often.They cancel services with no word of warning. They have on many occasion decided to cut out my stop mid-journey causing me to be late for work and needing 2 more changes. They have now cut out my station full stop since this new (but certainly not improved) timetable has been introduced.They are absolutely abominable. The service is disgraceful. I often have to stand on the trains because they cancel so many and then reduce the amount of carriages. I've been almost face to face with people in 25+ degree heat with no air conditioning. The trains are often filthy dirty and I found a flea having a good chew on my arm on the Victoria service just 2 days ago. This morning they outright cancelled my service.They are making it impossible to commute and hold down a job, even with understanding bosses. They couldn't organise a p*@s up in a brewery and I'm sick to death of waiting for trains.The nice staff that worked at the station I travel from seem to have disappeared and some surly men put in their place. I have absolutely nothing positive to say about Southern. The Government need to sort this out and fast. People are losing jobs.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2018-07-14T19:07:33Z	Southern trains are a disgrace!	Southern trains are a disgrace. My daughter has to go one stop to get to school. Southern has reduced the service down to one train from two and there are constant cancellations of that ONE train. Children as young as 11 are left standing at the station with no way to get to school. Also, tickets don’t work in machines leaving children stuck on unmanned stations. Southern doesn’t refund unused tickets bought in advance in London (to get round the ones that don’t work bought locally) as it’s not enough money to cover their ‘administration’ fee. I’ve never experienced such horrific service where children depend on it. I rarely give bad reviews; if you have nothing positive to say, stay silent. However, in this case Southern only gets one star because there’s no option to give zero stars!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2018-07-14T19:07:33Z	Timetable change	Before the timetable change, my fare up to London was £28. Now when I try to buy my ticket online, for the same time train, they want to charge me £67.  I am fortunate enough to know that the increase is down to Southern thinking the best way to get from East Croydon to West Croydon at that time is via Clapham Junction. I know I can still buy my £28 ticket, and walk from East to West (or tram if its raining) but I bet there are people who buy the expensive one because they don't realise.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

I'm not joking, I've been to third world countries and the trains are punctual as ever. You also don't mind if they're a bit late because the prices are ridiculously cheap.

She was told she'd have to take a train to Tunbridge Wells where a bus would be provided. Not knowing this, my partner went to Uckfield station to pick her up, and was perplexed when a train rolled in, then shortly afterwards, a coach with her cousin on it! My trips to London aren't frequent, but I have bought a railcard and have barely used it because the trains are cancelled so often, especially at weekends, but sometimes during the week. Tomorrow (April 22nd), I have to get to Norwood Junction. National Rail tells me that, I'd have to tour Sussex in a bus before arriving at my destination almost three hours later. If I wanted to travel by bus, it wouldn't cost me anything - I've a bus pass. Needless to say, I'll have to take the car.The last time I was able to take a train, the return journey was extremely poor. Sure, it wasn't Southern's fault that there'd been a points failure at Hurst Green, but it was their fault that we were all turfed off the train at Crowborough. It was dark, wet, there was a lady with children. There were no staff to tell us what we were supposed to do about getting ourselves home, no coaches, no local taxi firm had been informed.The on train staff were most apologetic, but they were just doing as they were told. I think the service is getting worse.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

I almost cried with joy when it was only 2 mins late once last month. On the other hand, if you allow an extra hour for your journey, you will almost certainly get there on time. And there's always the bonus of picking up heavily delayed previous trains.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2018-06-02T18:13:15Z	I changed jobs to avoid Southern Rail	I literally switched jobs to avoid Southern Rail’s awful, extortionate service. On the frequent instances when my train was delayed by hours or cancelled, the compensation scheme gatekeepers denied any claim I put forward without consideration. Once, my train was cancelled and the replacement bus service had a driver who quote, “got lost”, and drove us and the other passengers to a City an hours drive from our intended destination. Southern Rail is an embarrassment to Britain and a testament to the pernicious effect that the privatisation of natural monopolies can have on the quality of consumer services.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2018-06-02T18:13:15Z	Bad decision to amend timetable for local London services	Cannot see any reason why they insist on running an amended timetable for services between Dartford/Slade Green/Barnehurst and London when other train operators were running more normal services during the few days of snow. They may indeed have had  big problems further out into Kent but how would this affect the local London services that don't go further out than Dartford? Running less trains  no doubt contributed to the dreadful situation my daughter found herself in on Friday evening at Lewisham station. Apprently the driver was having traction problems even pulling out of the station and a lot of people wanted to get off then but he refused to open the doors resulting in a 3 hour wait when it got stuck a short distance outside the station.Eventually and after some people had jumped off the train the local police ordered everyone off. This was a relief as the toilets were all locked but no steps were provided leaving passengers of all ages to lower themselves onto very slippery sleepers. After walking back to the platform they found no station staff there to help and were not allowed to use the station toilets.My own experience was having to use buses as the massively reduced services were overwhelmed and not serving my route anyway.None of us are getting anything like value for money.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	2

Train delayed on way there and our return journey was terrible. Train indicated as late over the the tannoy but showing on time on the display board. Then suddely passengers were advised to go to another platform. Everyone hurriedly did so including ourselves only to find out that the train was then cancelled again. Then the next train was late and again we were redirected to another platform but that didn’t arrive either. On asking about the next available train, an attendant gave us the wrong information. Finally spoke with the Station Msnager who did offer to send us home in a taxi free of charge but my daughter didn’t want to risk travelling in a car with a baby and toddler and no car seats. So we spent almost 10 pounds in the cafe waiting for another half an hour and finally got back an hour and a half later to travel a distance of one stop witn a journey time of 10 minutes normally. And it was supposed to have been a treat for the toddler. Luckily he likes watching trains but waiting for an hour and a half on a mucky cold station isn’t my idea of fun. No wonder people prefer their cars.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

Had to get home as son had an accident. About a 20min delay (which I consider lucky in hindsight) which then meant my train then ran fast to Sutton instead of stopping at my usual stop.  Poor service is obviously not tied to fare prices as this went up to around £45 a week zone 1-4.  Would assume this is also the case if reviewing executive bonuses of Southern staff.  Just wished I was not at the mercy of this rail company who have a track record amongst customers and on the ground staff of disappointment, disruption, bad service, and ultimately based on this, failure at all fronts...	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

I was half way on my journey when there was an announcement made saying that we had to be on the 4 front carriages of where we wanted to get to our destination - Portsmouth. The trouble was I could barely hear what was being said as it was too quiet and muffled with lots of noise in the background and they spoke so quickly that I didn't get a word of it! What was worse was I couldn't even find a conductor on board! Fortunately one of the passengers then were able to advise. Secondly they don't do refreshments. They could at least offer tea and coffee. Last but not least they don't have power points so you can use your laptop or phone. For today's trains definitely of poor standard.

Staff couldn't care less but that's probably because they know that Southern are crap. They overcharge regularly. Was recently charged £168 for a journey that should have been £121. Complaints procedure is rubbish. They take 10 days to even respond. National Rail respond immediately and are really helpful. This company needs to be stripped of its franchise immediately.

2018-02-19T11:05:16Z	Disgrace	The only reason I can imagine for the fare increase is to pay for the blindfolded drunk chimpanzee on a swivel chair randomly throwing darts at half a tea stained timetable on a wall in one of your offices,as this seems to be how you pick what time trains arrive at random stations. A disgrace of a service, all involved should be sacked and shamed for allowing this farce to continue for so long.I got a train yesterday and half expected all the doors to fall off and glitter to shoot out of the sides all over everyone waiting, as it’s clearly clowns running this buffoon of a service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

Yet on operational journeys they are everywhere ? Funny that .

Bravo!He is a role model of Southern Railway staff whose small act of kindness made a tremendous impact to re-gain the public's trust on this company that had been on the six o'clock news for all sorts of wrong reasons in the past!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	5

2018-02-19T11:05:16Z	Who could give Southern more than one star?!!!  Not a regular user.	"I find it incredible that there are any reviews here that are not at the minimum stars.  Like many others, I wish I could give negative stars.I also sincerely believe that the low house prices in my area of South London / Surrey are completely due to the appalling Southern train service stopping people wanting to move to the area.  I cannot list the full catalogue of errors but have Liked so many other posters who have listed them.  And try to get a refund for a late or cancelled train.  I once made the mistake of calling and realised the staff are younger than the trains, based in the West country and don't even know what stations are on what lines.  I never get refunds because I ""can't provide ticket proof"" when a train doesn't arrive and I have to take multiple trains to a nearby station to get home.  Taking a different route does not count even when your train has disappeared.What other industry in 2017 could get away with such a detrimental strike to thousands of customers for so long?  What other industry severely overpays uneducated staff just because they belong to a union?  And the management pay is also undeserved.So often the service is like being on a ghost train.  You don't know when it will arrive or even if it will arrive at all.  Trains frequently disappear off of the departure boards and the staff at ticket offices are non-existent during popular times of the day but definitely open for business during holidays when nobody is travelling but when they are probably paid extra."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

I also haven't even seen a guard on the train for over a week, so the striking was really worth it. Their twitter is also pointless, they only answer the questions that don't make them look really bad...which is most of them and issue multiple meaningless apologies which arent backed up by action.

2017-12-13T21:19:26Z	It is impossible to imagine a poorer …	It is impossible to imagine a poorer service than that currently operated by Southern. I have now given up on using the train as one can never be sure of arriving in London on time for business meetings or being able to get home to Eastbourne in the evenings. The sheer number of “Cancelled” services, inexplicably diverted services, replacement bus services, or lame excuses over unavailable staff, signal or points failures, is now beyond belief and entirely unacceptable. This week, a person was apparently “taken ill” on a train at Clapham, which effectively resulted in cancelled or delayed services across the whole Southern network. Why was this person not just removed from the train? Why did it have to interrupt the travel plans of countless thousands of commuters? Given the number of people travelling on the network it is obvious that by the law of averages someone will occasionally be taken ill. But why should it adversely affect so many other services? I have now decided never to use Southern again but to drive everywhere in future. The roads are already congested but it is cheaper and one is still more confident of getting to and fro between the capital and the Coast on time to conduct one’s working life. It’s a shameful, catastrophically poor service and an indisputable argument for re-nationalisation, or the removal of Southern’s franchise. Only that, or the sacking of the entire management, is likely to lead to the necessary improvements to what is an almost laughably abysmal service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

The train was initially on time and then became more and more daelayed and finally cancelled. Tired and  freezing cold I approached the guy at the help desk who took for ever to acknowledge that I was even there, I asked when would the next train to East Dulwich be, to what he answered: doesn’t it say on the main info table!? I got really annoyed and asked if he’s expecting me to tap out just to have a look at the info table and tap back in!!!?? To what he said I was aggressive!!! Aggressive??? the man is not even doing his job! Is unhelpful and unsympathetic to a customer whose train got cancelled, so I Told him that if he was trying to get home after nightshift and the trains got cancelled, he would would also be annoyed!!

2017-12-13T21:19:26Z	Would rather stick pins in my eyes	I honestly cannot qualify or quantify quite how angry this company makes me, I often describe it as being the only rail company in the world that have never seen a train. It's like they don't even understand the prospect of it.Luckily I get the daily south western railway service return from swanwick to Portsmouth and southsea, but only too often do we have to wait for unmeasurable amounts of time due to late southern service. What's worse is that if I don't want to wait 40 minutes in the evening for a SWR service I have to change at fareham onto what should be a 6 minute train journey from fareham to swanwick on the Southern service between London Victoria and Southampton Central. This service is unique in the fact that they daily pretend this service runs hourly however it never does. It never actually turns up to the station and is cancelled pretty much every day. When it does turn up it's regularly late by about 20 Minutes which is disgraceful by anyone's standards.I have also in the past been on a southern service between swanwick and southampton central where the train simply decided not to stop at the station I was supposed to be getting off at which was st Denys. I ended up missing a connecting service and then the next service at Southampton was cancelled so I was over an hour late to a rehearsal, absolute joke.I honestly would rather bathe in the fiery pits of hell than catch a southern service ever again although I'm sure the owners of southern rail will be there soon too.Can't name anything worse in this world.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

When you're paying between £50,000 and £70,000 to drivers to ""drive"" something they don't even need to steer, then it's no wonder the fares are expensive. Constant strikes, regarding guards wanting to push a button, reminds me of toddlers not getting their own way, ""Let me push it daddy"", all under the guise of health and safety, they think the public are stupid!

I have contacted them several times - they sent me vouchers to cover the cost of the tube tickets we had to buy which I will never use so am out of pocket and they should compensate us for the inconvenience of all the additional travel and making us much later home then planned, however they continue with the bog standard responses which seem to completely miss the point that their train did not run and was never going to.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	2

Just when you think they cant get any worse they install new ticket machines that work one day in five and when they do work they take money without giving tickets.When you go to the station to report this you are told they know about the problem and to buy a ticket on the train. This  would be fine if you could move along the train to find a conductor but they are to busy. Or often no conductor on board. Then you get to Brighton station and are held hostage until you queue for a ticket often 10-15 people long with one person to serve. To make matters worse their aren't any alternative rail providers on my route. Avoid using this company unless you absolutely have to the sooner they lose the franchise the better.

2017-06-12T13:57:39Z	Bus replacement service shambles	This is a zero or minus star rating not one star.Do not rely on the bus replacement service to a. Get you to the train station for an hourly train station or b. Pick up all passengers waiting to board the bus after alighting from the train.My journey started when Iarrived at Barnham at 9.20 and got on waiting bus for 9.45 replacement station to Arundel for the 10.15 train. This is a 10 minute journey.  The witless bus company lady put everyone on the same single decker bus going to London or along the south coast.  There were four empty buses some of them double decker.  Our bus the first to leave and left earlier than scheduled but was the last to arrive at Arundel and we missed the 10.15 and waited an hour for the next one.  Why? We were first sent to Littlehampton where a few people got off and more got on.  Then they asked the south coast travellers to get off as there was another bus behind.  We never saw it and were held for a further 10 minutes.  We then departed and found a road closure sign for the A27 Arundel road.  Instead of going back to Littlehampton which happened to be in the right direction and take a different route. There are at least two. We did a ten mile detour in the opposite direction. I shouted to the driver that a call should be made to hold the train as we had only ten minutes to arrive at he station, get off the bus and board the train.  No response just apologies.  Some people missed their flights at Gatwick as a result.On the return journey, we got off the train at Arundel to be greeted by a single decker bus. I luckily managed to get on and had to stand. Not everyone was able to get on and were told to wait for the next bus which would be in an hour. On arriving back at Barnham there were four buses including two double decker remaining idle. Do they not think people arriving back on the 5.02 from London want to get home. How did they fail to plan for sufficient bus seats? On arriving back at Barnham I challenged the ticket officer and the young wet, behind the ears lad in charge of the buses and was astounded to find they had no contact with Arundel station or that there was a representative from the bus company there to ensure the safety and smooth transition of the rail and bus service. Nor did anyone have any other solutions than for customers to make a complaint and handed out a leaflet.  These people are so used to providing a poor service, they just shrug it off. Thy seemed surprised that I cared enough about the welfare of the abandoned passengers to fight their corner.  Everyone on duty that day needs to face a disciplinary, docked a days wages and go on a training course to learn about responsibility, planning, communication and plain old common sense.  Of course it won't happen. But if it did, the service would soon be putting customers first.Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...........	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2017-06-12T13:57:39Z	Never got re-funded for a delayed train	Never got re-funded for a train delayed for over an hour, which is in their policy. No customer service, still trying over a month later to receive money, only for them to repeatedly dodge responsibility or tell me they will contact me later with no response. Very poor service and obviously do not want to fulfill their own policies	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2017-06-12T13:57:39Z	Poor Service	Every time I travel with Southern the trains are delayed or cancelled with various excuses. Overall a very poor service, with very little focus on the customers. Having travelled on other train networks I know it is possible to achieve a reliable service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2017-06-12T13:57:39Z	Southern Rail are a joke	Southern Rail are the worst railway company in London without a doubt. Their trains never run on time, I have no idea what percentage of their trains are just cancelled, but I can assure you it's a lot! They take far longer than usual to get anywhere, they travel at snails pace. Overall they are very unreliable, if your planning a trip with southern rail you may need to add hours onto your journey.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2017-06-12T13:57:39Z	Perfect service - May 31st 2017	I had a great service on Friday 31st May - I was travelling from Gatwick to Polegate late evening and had heavy bags. A male ticket inspector helped me with my bags and helped me to move to a different carriage. He was very courteous and I just want to say thank you for a great service!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	5
2017-06-12T13:57:39Z	Please someone else take over the company	Very ironic that we have all these strikes for driver fearing losing there job, but the trains from Streatham hill seem to be cancelled due to lack of drivers?! Doesn't seem to make sense. Southern do not know what they are doing!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2017-06-12T13:57:39Z	Very bad service	Simple trip from Horsham to Portsmouth turned into a nightmare. Train came late and then halfway through the journey it got cancelled all together. Turfed off at a station in the middle of nowhere and then another change required to get where we were going. Coming home train late and then terminated at Horsham, sorry to those hoping to get to Victoria. Poor service, I feel sorry for those that have to use Southern Rail regularly.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2017-06-12T13:57:39Z	Delay repayment system sucks	So it is okay for your train to be 15-20 mins late and you claim delay repayment fare costing 3.90 and you get back £1 beyond a joke, complete waste of time in putting in your request if that is what you get!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2017-06-12T13:57:39Z	Got me from A to B on time	The price seemed ok for the journey I made.Got me to where I wanted to go on time.  Seemed safe, clean and the guy on the gate where I got on at seemed friendly enough.  Didn't really see any other staff, The only thing that I found annoying was the automatic announcements on the train.Dunno what all the fuss is over.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	5

"On the 18:30 train to Brighton from London Victoria which the scrolling digital indicator calls the ""Gatwick Express"" - except it doesn't actually stop there and there was no guard/ driver announcement to tell people not to believe the indicator. So a party of foreign tourists who were stupid enough to believe what they read have been let down by Southern Fail and are likely to miss their flights.  You couldn't make up their incompetance. On top of their usual dismal performance on non-strike days."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2017-06-12T13:57:39Z	Dreadful.	Delayed. Slow. Inconsistent. Indifferent. Constantly overtaken by more efficient more rapid alternative train operators ie South Western rail/Gatwick Express etc. The unforgivable ongoing issues between company and unions have no effect on attitude towards customers. The whole operation should be disenfranchised and the operation put out afresh to tender	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2017-06-12T13:57:39Z	Patience exhausted	Have been a regular rail commuter from Sussex to London for over 35 years: British Rail Network Southeast/SouthCentral, Connex and now Southern Fail. The service was bad. It is now worse, and deteriorating. I didn't believe it was possible, but it is getting progressively worse than bl**dy awful. I am starting to look for a job outside London so that I can shake the dust of this benighted dung-heap from my shoes forever. I can't begin to describe the anger and disgust I feel towards the whole shower of them, management, unions et al.

2017-06-12T13:57:39Z	Most vile company	Southern rail actually makes me feel sick. Your trains are always late if they come at all !! They take hours longer than they should. the honest truth is that the idea of using your service makes me want to pull my own hair out ! Today I got a fine for not having a ticket I know all my fault as your wonder ignorant rude vile train police told me I went up and asked for help due to the ticket machine not working and the conductor being awol !!!! I went and asked can I please buy my ticket explained my predicament oh no that doesn't matter it's allllll my fault !!! Not the fault of your company oh no because your ticket machines don't work and your conductors are where ? Oh yeah on strike !!!! You have these train police cornering 3 young girls causing one to burst in to tears !! Who exactly do you think you are ? Fining people for a service that they don't even get ! How dare you. Why I'm typing this i don't know as you will probably ignore it like you do all the problems you're having. Shame on you.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2017-01-15T09:48:33Z	Run by incompetant insenstive bullies absolute disgrace	Its all been said before but I hope the management of Southern Railways get their just deserts for a total lack of an morals around safety and being prepared accept the risk of human life (the lives of their passengers) to save money.

2017-01-15T09:48:33Z	Worse then a 3rd war country's train service	Dear sir/ madam Over the last 10 month of a cummuter using southern rails service it has caused me nothing but trouble getting yo college in Hastings from hampden park and back again. I am feed up with your service that frankly is more worse then a 3rd war world country's train service and how much disrespect you and the unions have show to your travelling passengers. You have made many of us very late getting to college for important exams over the last 10 months and whist I am on the subject of that my college called sussex coast college in Hastings has had to but it's own rail replacement buses on to and from college which I do respect them for doing but they should not have too  this over the 10 months has cost them about £2,000 how about your unions and southern it's self get there act together cancell the next stricks in the next couple of weeks and start actually coming up with solutions to how to solve this problem because my college is not the only one out of pocket because or the pettness between you and the unions so stop arguing around a table and say you are coming up with solutions to this problem and start listening to the real important people who are very angry call your customers because after all we are the one that matter not that it feels like it at the moment  why not get your fingers out of your backside and start showing some respect.

I will avoid the train at all costs now.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2017-01-15T09:48:33Z	I support the strikers	I agree with the staff on strike and the drivers, yes, you do need another member of staff on a train apart from the driver. It's plain common sense and an obvious safety issue. If Southern rail can't see that, they don't deserve to run a rail company for the general public. And has been stated over and over again...train companies never have had so much money in the kitty. I suspect it's shareholders and not  passenger welfare that's the real issue here.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2017-01-15T09:48:33Z	If only you could give no stars.	Sat freezing cold on a platform yet again because of Southern Rail's incompetence. This time no information that we were delayed or why on the train and missed the connection. Now nobody at this station and limited information on the boards. I have missed countless social occasions, been late for work too many times and been stranded until late at night often, with barely just minimal abrupt information from disgruntled staff, and yet have no choice but to keep using this pitiful service. Seems to be the only place in the country that struggles with the concept of organised services quite so much. It's a joke, a nuisance and waste of everyone's time! Thanks for ruining yet another evening!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2017-01-15T09:48:33Z	It's not just the train service it' …	It's not just the train service it's the whole set up. Trying to obtain a refund from April 2016 where I decided not to travel due to a strike day I eventually got my refund (including some deserved compensation for the hassle) in November 2016.....seven whole months later! Most of the time they take at least 3-4 weeks to get back to you (if at all), then they lost my tickets, then my correspondence and finally emailed me addressing me by Mr. ******* , who was a member of their own staff. Laugh...you have to I guess? They should be stripped of the running of Southern.....they are simply not up to it from the top to the bottom.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

Was hoping to catch a train after work to go home, but instead got  two times in a row canceled trains in two days then I stopped using the crap green trains. My girlfriend got four canceled trains in a row after work yesterday and was late for two hours. Just pure random chance to go home with this railway service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2017-01-15T09:48:33Z	Trip to Gatwick Christmas Eve	At least some trains running but couldn't believe the state of the windows as so dirty could hardy see out... seemed like weeks of grime and so different to Southwest Trains that I use often, carriages outside always gleaming.    Seems it's not just drivers, guards unhappy even the cleaning schedule not happening.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	2
2017-01-15T09:48:33Z	Embarrassment	We don't care whose fault all the problems are (unions, government, staff, management, leaves, etc, etc). The bottom line is as passengers we are let down on a frequent basis. Sometimes not even able to make essential journeys to work or see family etc.I wonder what first impression this gives to those visiting the U.K. arriving via Gatwick airport? Not good I would suggest. All those involved should be ashamed of the end product.

2017-01-15T09:48:33Z	Southern Rail: So Glad I Moved Away	I commuted from Redhill for 28 years, and saw a service which just got worse every year.  The old slam door trains of British Rail days may have had their faults but generally they got to London Bridge faster than first franchise holder Notwork SouthCentral,  and very much quicker than the totally rubbish service offered by Southern.  Southern are just one big rip off company who con politicians and the travelling public with excessive fares and poor service, while their totally useless self-important managers stuff their pockets with commuters hard-earned cash and care nothing for customers.  They took over the franchise with glossy magazine slogans about 'The Renaissance of the Great British Railway' which soon turned out to be the sickest of jokes given their poor service and total lack of customer care.  They really havn't got the first idea of how to efficiently run a railway franchise and their trains on the Brighton line (and others) are now the most expensive, slowest and most unreliable in Europe - slower than the UK's golden age of steam. They have totally failed the travelling public and should be stripped of the franchise without delay.  I am so glad I sold up and moved away from Redhill as I couldn't stand their daily excuses any longer.  I can only advise long suffering commuters on Southern to take direct action to get rid of them;  to refuse to pay fares; to drive over to the nearest Southeastern network station and catch more reliable trains up to town; to car share to the nearest London tube;  and to keep doing it until the government listens (most unlikely)  or you manage to bankrupt the whole rotten company. Boycott them by campaigning for fast regular coach services, start community rail groups to get rid of them, but most of all stop buying their rip off season tickets.  They will soon start to listen when it hurts their fat pockets. Good luck to you all. Signed Very Angry of Tunbridge Wells - Kent is one hell of a great escape from the totally dreadful Southern.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2017-01-15T09:48:33Z	If you can travel by another route, DO IT!	I try and use the trains everyday because they're usually the fastest and most convenient method of travel around me. The service i receive though is terrible, almost everyday they're delayed if not cancelled and when they are, the staff are not bothered or helpful at all. Although even though you may get terrible service and cancelled trains, they'll try and take your money from you in every single situation besides having extraordinarily high ticket prices for what poor service they offer. Such a monopolised company as no real other fast travel to get around locally whilst also travelling afar. 2/10 When the trains are on time it works OK, other than that, terrible, unacknowledged staff and sky high (and rising) ticket prices.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2017-01-15T09:48:33Z	Awful service, sick of strikes being organised by Unions !	What an awful over priced service this company offers. I only wish everybody could strike at the drop of a hat, as these people do. Wouldn't it be nice if another industry went on strike, say shipping/transport, meaning these 'workers' couldn't do their online shopping and receive Christmas Presents, or get their groceries. The same level of inconsiderate disruption they are causing to thousands of peoples lives.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2016-12-06T12:02:35Z	Money grabbing c**ts.	If there was one word I could describe this service that word would be S**T. I get a train from London Victoria to Selhurst every weekday and 3 out of the 5 times I get it a week there are cancellations or delays. Never have I received any compensation or anything to contribute towards my journey cost but instead I get to where I need to be late and have to pay out for it. They should make this service free because I don't know what I'm paying for because it's definalty not the BS that I'm getting at the moment. Good luck if you need to get the service one day. Oh and also remember to turn up at least 1hr early for your train to make sure you can get the one that was delayed 1hr before yours!!!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-12-06T12:02:35Z	Travelled across Italy on Public transport but was let down in the UK by your Joke of a service	Firstly why has this service not been taken away from you beggars belief, in most European countries you would have had thousands of people turning up at your offices with pitchforks.On Thursday 1st of December I boarded a Prontobus from Pescara to Rome, which was on-time and cost just 20 euros to travel 207km, I then boarded and on-time EasyJet flight from Rome to Gatwick then paid £15 for a single ticket to Eastbourne only to discover due to a signal fault all the trains to Eastbourne had been cancelled with no replacement bus service. I then had to get a train to Brighton and then a Taxi to Eastbourne at a cost of £50.And this is not the first time, everyday the trains are cancelled or delayed, in fact I rarely have seen a train run on time in the last 9 months.For a company posting record profits and raising the prices in January, this is just madness.I have actually started getting the bus to Brighton to work during the week as at £6.50 return, they not only run on time but also offer free Wifi.I just feel sorry for the other commuters I talked to on Thursday who have to put up with your appalling service on a daily basis. I can honestly say I will never use your service again until the government pull their heads out of their backsides and rip away the franchise from you complete crooks.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-12-06T12:02:35Z	Suggestion	Couldn't get a train from Victoria to East Grinstead so I had to take the last service. Its late, tough day and all I want is to go straight to bed, together with probably the rest of passengers.The train was originally supposed to depart at 22: 54 and finally departed at 23: 44 because we were waiting for THE DRIVER TO SHOW UP! I mean, I understand that it must be hard to run a company like this, but SERIOUSLY? We pay tons of money every month (daily, weekly, or whichever) and we get DELAYS, CANCELLATIONS. Some because of weather conditions I understand, BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO SHOW UP TO WORK? That's unacceptable. At least they should have 10 more drivers and staff for situations like this. Because WE PAY FOR IT, THEREFORE WE EXPECT A GOOD SERVICE.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-12-06T12:02:35Z	20 minute delays or cancelled as standard.	These days 20 minute delays are absolutely the norm, where trains are not cancelled altogether.Of course this is completely unacceptable but this has become so routine that most people barely even question a 20min delay on Southern any more. Of course you can't claim for a 20min delay. You can only claim if it's delayed by 30 mins or more, but of course any given train is cancelled rather than ever reaching the 30 minute mark! Their service is absolutely awful, disgusting, abysmal. It's a wonder that they're even allowed to call it a service any more. But then Southern pretty much have commuters over a barrel, so there's precious little anyone can actually do about it. Yay for deregulation and privatisation!! It works so well!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-12-06T12:02:35Z	Train to Victoria from Horsham suddenly rerouted to London Bridge whilst in transit!	I have tried to avoid all train travel in the last couple of months. Southern have ruined so many trips in recent weeks both for work and pleasure. Today I caught the train from Horsham to Clapham to meet my son for my birthday. We set off - late of course - and the guard has just announced that we are now going to London Bridge and he didn't know. We will have to get off and change. Unbelievable.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-12-06T12:02:35Z	If you want to be robbed look no further!	This company is disgusting I don't even know where to start, dirty trains, toilets out of use, over crowded .... And let's not forget they never run on time! I have been using Southern as unfortunately there's no other choice from my local station for 2 years now, I have never had a train be on time.Cancellations, strikes the lot .... Many days I have turned up and not been able to get to work it's actually become so bad I have had to buy my own car (this has become the cheaper option to as I can actually make it to work and get paid).Fares are still going up, how? My petrol is way cheaper than a train ticket so why would anyone still want to use this service that can only garentee either: you're not getting to work today with us! Or you will be late for work today if you stick to southern rail ..... Sickening!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

Not even rail replacement busses so I couldn't go and because I couldn't go I didn't have the information I needed to complete my assignment and so have jeopardised my degree course. Too say I'm angry is in fact an understatement, I'm seriously considering sending in a letter of complaint and some sort of compensation as this degree course cost me £2000 for this module alone!!

Every single train.I'm now moving out due to Southern's failure.Update 13.1.17 - now they're thwarting me on the gatwick express! Ticket machines don't sell gatwick express singles or open returns.

2016-12-06T12:02:35Z	Worst UK company by far	Pay a premium price for a truly shocking third world service. I have travelled twice a day in 2016 and only been on time three times.

2016-12-06T12:02:35Z	Truly a shower of ****	I would say avoid at all costs, but if you find yourself using them, sadly you probably couldn't avoid them. They take shambles and incompetence to a whole new level. Truly a parody of a train operator, a national embarrassment and disgrace. Do they care? Why would they as they rake in profit irrespective of how badly they perform. If using them, best of luck and assume your planned train will be very delayed or more likely cancelled.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-12-06T12:02:35Z	Unacceptable, shocking, sad..	I moved to a new house next to a Southern Rail station 2 months ago and I have already experience last week the third three day strike..I am completely disappointed and this is unacceptable. When there are no strikes the service is still shocking. Never on time and trains cancellations often.I could go on and on but the only thing that should happen here is that I pay 50% of what I am currently paying monthly to this company as they are only providing me with half of their services.I used South West trains for the last 9 years and never had any problems.I would like Southern Rail to be in trouble after their continues issues as I keep hearing that they are making an awful amount of money while all of us are losing time, money, patient and part of our lives every day.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2016-12-06T12:02:35Z	Appalling service, almost daily...	Firstly, I shall make clear some facts about Southern Railway... Southern Railway is purely the name of the rail service, operated over parts of Surrey,  East and West Sussex, Hampshire,  Kent and South London.  The name of the company running Southern Railway, is Govia.  Govia run a number of franchises, including Southern Railway, Thameslink South Eastern, Gatwick Express and Great Northern. Southern Railway is officially, the worst rail service in Britain and has remained so for some time. As a result of this abysmal service, I have been forced to move home, closer to my work and removing the need to use Southern Railway at all! I would also argue, that if the problems with Southern Railway persist, then this could begin to affect house prices and housing rental costs, reducing prices and rents in Southern Railway served areas and increasing prices and rents in areas on the Tube, or well managed lines, such as South Western Railway. The problems... Poor punctuality of trains. Short trains. Over crowding. Dirty trainsExcessive engineering work Lack of compensation and little awareness of how to claim it. Trains are delayed for many reasons, but Southern Railway seem to have more reasons than most! Here are a list (valid or not)... Signal failures -  prevent trains from moving and cause extensive back logs of trains in both directions.  Can cause long delays. Driver shortages / Guard shortages - Causes either delays of specific trains or cancellation of those trains and, if extensive,  can cause back logs of trains at terminuses such as Victoria, London Bridge and Brighton. Engineering work -  will either cause the shut down of a particular line over the works period, or a drastically reduced service, diverted on to fewer tracks.Short trains -  this causes back logs of passengers in peak periods. Although the train actually runs (whether punctual or not) many passengers at later stations in the journey, will not be able to board the train, due to lack of space and carriages.  This causes an increased number of passengers trying to board subsequent services and causes more delays. Ill passengers - illness of a passenger, can delay specific trains and cause short to medium back logs of trains. Trespassers on the line -  this causes major delays, as police have to be called and power supplies to track sections turned off, preventing trains from running. Lack of station staff - thus could allow passengers to board wrong trains, thereby sending them to incorrect destinations and substantially delaying their arrival at a correct destination. Overcrowding - this in itself causes delays, because of the lengthened time it takes to load and unload passengers at stations, whilst passengers are trying to squeeze on trains. Over crowding is caused by delayed trains, whereby long waits, cause crowds to form on platforms. Over crowding is also caused by short trains, where passengers are forced to stay on the platform, due to lack space on the train. Lack of awareness of how to claim compensation - If your train is delayed by more than thirty minutes, you are entitled to compensation.  But who knows how to claim it?   Would you seriously bother?! All of the above issues are now under the scrutiny of the government, with the hope that Govia will have their franchise removed and TfL will take over. Tfl appear to have a very high customer satisfaction rate, especially on the Overground network.  They are now successfully running train services in North East London too. Govia's management put profit before customer service. Indeed, it could be believed that Govia cancel Southern Railway trains in order to save money and double the income on trains that do subsequently run (albeit late!). The mere fact that they want to remove guards on trains, in favour of one man trains, is an indication of how hell bent they are on pleasing the share holders. Railways are for the efficient transportation of the public, not money trees for share kiddies. Hang your heads in shame Govia management. You are an utter disgrace and I have absolutely NO respect or trust in you. The directors of Govia should be investigated and held to account.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-12-06T12:02:35Z	Beyond usless	If you can sacrifice a pound of flesh to avoid traveling with southern, do it. They are completely and utterly incapable of delivering anything approaching a useful service. Expensive, smelly, overcrowded, delays and cancellations, all amount to a 'service' that would test even the most patient of people. If you have to be somewhere then you just simply can't rely on them, I have missed flights, plays and social events as well as being late for work countless times they have made my life miserable for months and it looks set to continue. How they can face themselves I simply don't know.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-12-06T12:02:35Z	Another useless experience	So last week there were no trains from Victoria to Gatwick on Sunday.. And the replacement bus to Clapham Junction took 30mins and then there were still no direct trains to Gatwick. So i missed my plane. Costing me £300.This week they cancelled the 1519 Ore to Gatwick service when it got to Eastbourne. With no notice. They are crooks and should not be allowed to run a railway.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-12-06T12:02:35Z	Probably the worst, most unreliable Rail operating company in the world	Last Friday evening due to get the 17-39 train to Eastbourne Station from East Croydon Station but this was cancelled a few minutes before due. Then got the 17-44 train to Ore via Eastbourne but when it arrived late at Haywards Heath we were told that a driver to continue the journey was not available. Waited and waited then told the train would go via Brighton Station instead. Then after more delays train finally left for Brighton where the train stopped for a long time. A new conductor boarded the train but he could not speak English properly and it was almost impossible to understand what he was saying. Train arrived at destination over an hour late. Southern Rail management are entirely responsible for the disastrous unreliable service they provide. It must be hell for the train drivers and guards/conductors employed by Southern Rail to have to bear the brunt of abuse from rail users through no fault of their own. Southern Rail should be fined hundreds of millions of pounds and lose their franchise immediately.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-09-26T19:00:46Z	Utterly useless numpties.	"Yet again another long day at work is rewarded with a delayed and overcrowded journey home on the Uckfield line. Thanks Southern, your incompetence is noteworthy.*Update* Now the following morning and the train is cancelled, still, not to worry, the next one is running late and formed of less coaches. I hope their Christmas party isn't planned to take place in a brewery.*Another Update* attempting to get home again, a mere 35 hours after my last post and my train is..drumroll...cancelled and the next one. Damn they're good, I mean seriously good at being useless. Hats off to them it's impressive stuff.*Yet another update* wow this is turning into a really rubbish blog. Train cancelled on way home last night and again on way in this morning. Best excuse ever ""train was late leaving the depot"". Bad train, sack it. Or was it really: poor maintenance? Poor management? Conductor/driver late to work? A broken nail? Sack them all, disband RMT, nationalise critical national infrastructure including commuter rail links.Guess what? Yep. Another update. Day 1 of the 3 day strike (for this week). Drive 10 miles to nearest station where we have been assured a service is running and....All cancelled for next 2 hours!! So pleased I got up extra early and inconvenienced my mother in law to come early to look after the kids. Etc etc. Ad Nauseam. Do you realise, Southern, how this is seriously messing with people's lives?  It's beyond not ok. It's an absolute shambolic disgrace. I can't be bothered posting anymore."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2016-09-26T19:00:46Z	Southern Rail is crap	Not a week goes by with a service being cancelled or having to find an alternative train journey to get home.Today there was no relief Conductor at Red Hill so the Train was terminated and I had to wait for the 3rd Train to get home.About 15 Minutes and compared to other waits I have had for a Southern Service that is good.I had to select one star for this rating but if they would let you select 0 or minus I would.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-09-26T19:00:46Z	Appalling - brighton via Gatwick Southern Rail train cancelled - may miss plane	I have joined the thousands of victims whose day has been seriously spoilt  by this appalling company. Up at 4am in order to catch the 0509 to Gatwick.  Train now cancelled.  And may miss flight. A lovely start to a holiday is now a hugely stressful experience. And I sincerely hope this useless rail company is replaced by a decent provider that delivers a reliable service not a never ending series of disasters.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-09-26T19:00:46Z	A disaster of a company	"Got free corporate tickets to the Brighton game. I avoid using Southern Fail like I avoid penis cancer but due to wanting a drink, the tsport being included i.e. free, and it being 3 f'in stops I thought what could go wrong.Got there fine. No issues. 5 minutes into the 2nd half announcement comes over the tannoy. ""Major distuption to the trains. The first train after the finish departs ONE HOUR after the game.""F' that. We and hundreds of other PAYING fans left after 10 mins into the 2nd half to avoid getting home at ridiculous O'clock.Cretinous, awful awful awful company.I avoid using their service for precisely this reason took a gamble by relying on them and they still manged to f' up a journey in the evening midweek.The football club even put on emergency transport for fans. So another completely unrelated business is picking up their slack."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-09-26T19:00:46Z	Terrible train service, terrible company	A railway company on which one can almost always, without fail, guarantee cancellations on any given line on any given day is quite frankly not a real railway company. Southern consistently fails to deliver on its most basic operational output; getting customers from A to B within the timeframe they require.A joke of a company, and a disgrace to the nation.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-09-26T19:00:46Z	Complete Joke, Not The Funny Kind	Conductors go on strike because they don't want their jobs to be cut or undermined, but the reality of it is that the conductors are never on time or are 'ill' meaning trains are delayed or cancelled, so what's the point in having them anyway. This joke of a company need to sort their **** out, and they need to do it soon.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-09-26T19:00:46Z	Rotten service!	My 25th wedding anniversary on 7 September and months ago I booked an afternoon tea at the Savoy in London to celebrate our special day. Due to selfish strike action we have now had our very special day absolutely ruined - well done Southern Rail!!!! This is a one-off for me, as I don't use this service very often but I do feel extremely sorry for the poor commuters who have to face this rotten service every day. Selfish SR employees, holding people to ransom, charging extortionate prices and giving an absolute rubbish service!!  Shame on you!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-09-26T19:00:46Z	Worst service EVER	"I moved in tunbridge wells and I'm commuting in London for work since 4 Months ago. Since then I've been always late, trains delayed every single day, morning and evening trains as well, for at least, and I repeat, AT LEAST 5/10 minutes to a max of 30/40 minutes. I got to walk fast to be at work in time and most of the times I'm late anyway!!  And all this comes with the ""cheapest""price ever, which in my case is 420 pounds pcm!!!!!! 5k per year!!! Half of a flat rent bill and 1/4 of my income!!!! And you can't even complain your money back if the train is late less than 30 minutes!!! What the hell is wrong with you!!! Get down those prices if you can't afford to run a good service!! People are paying tons of money to run your service and you repay us with delays and bad service! Someone have to do something about it!!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-09-26T19:00:46Z	MPs need to get involved!!!!	I am regularly late to work due to this service... How trains can be cancelled first thing in the morning I don't know. I've sat at harlington station for hours waiting for a train because they cancel every single one. I always check online before attempting to board this train and if it is 'on-time' I will get train train instead of driving (as its a lot quicker than battling traffic/parking) however on many occasions I am very disappointed to have no announcement and no sign of delays, just a 'missing' train... Or it will go from on time to cancelled 2 minutes before it's due to arrive because of 'missing conductors'. 1- how did they not know that earlier 2- that is no way to run a business. Today on the way home from work I arrived at the train station to see that every single southern service for every destination was delayed by a minimum of 25 minutes. I have written letters of complaint to the customer service teams and haven't even been acknowledged. Don't bother trying to get your money back because you won't.. If you can avoid this service please do	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2016-09-26T19:00:46Z	Conductors should be sacked	Unbelievable number of cancellations and late trains due to conductors. The train I was on was cancelled as the conductor went missing. Disgraceful behaviour for people who feel entitled to a job rather than having a need for the role. No method of effectively complaining. No one willing to help passengers who have been feeling the pain for months.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2016-09-26T19:00:46Z	Abject misery, A national scandal	Abject misery is all I can say without swearing!  I live on the coast and have no alternative to getting to London. People are giving up their jobs for the sake of sanity. For this to be happening in GB in 2016 is a monumental scandal and a national disgrace. I dont have to explain what is wrong. Its literally everything!! I could try and write what is good about it but there is only one word. NOTHING! This franchise has to go. Its been bad for some years and its not just about this latest dispute. The last franchise was useless but this current one is less than useless	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-09-26T19:00:46Z	Worse service ever....looking alternatives	Here why I m saying that:Lost my season ticket, followed the process and I received a letter saying they are not satisfy about the claim and advise me to go back to the counter. The counter refuses to fill another form and said to me he already done and will not do it again. Let me remind this is not a free service they charge 20£ to renew it.Station staff not trained which leads staff being rude( spent 10 min to renew my season ticket)My local station(Norbury) which unfortunately operates southern are the worse service in the country. Forget about the trains delay and cancellation I m talking about processes and staff....	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2016-09-26T19:00:46Z	Just the worst train company ever.	I leave one  hour early than I should for work to make sure I actually get there on time and my return train has never arrived on time. NEVER.It may be 3-4 mins late or normally 10-15 but it has NEVER pulled into the station on time. Once more -  NEVER !I hate Southern with a passion. Trains are old, broken down, heating off in winter, on in summer. Dirty, smelly and overcrowded. Most conductors could not give a rats bum about bothering to update the passengers about delays or trains being held.  They hide when you need them, but decide to check tickets at an ungodly hour of the morning because its the only time they can move through the overcrowded trains.The one star is A: because I can't give them 0 and B: because the Twitter team are unfailingly nice in the face all of the crap they put up with from passengers (justified frustrations) and Management.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-09-26T19:00:46Z	Give me an alternative.	What an amazingly bad organisation. Classic monopoly. The idea that competition can work when you give out monopolies is incredible. This morning I discovered a new season ticket on my key card. Not mine. Not even the right station. Just added by a member of staff. The one I had bought would not load due to gate failure. Who knows what will happen next. Unfortunately the gov has given govia too many routes	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-09-26T19:00:46Z	Couldn't organise a p@*s up in a brewery	By far the worst train service in the country, what should take 1hour twenty to get home has often taken me four to five house! The government needs to remove the franchise from Govia who have bitten off more than they can chew and sort it out. I doubt it was even this bad in BR days. You turn up to the station crossing your fingers it's going to be okay and invariably they let you down. Please please sort it out. If you don't have enough staff employ more it's not simple! This is the busiest commuter route on the network it needs to work!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-08-09T21:53:28Z	3rd world train services have fewer delays.	i recently damaged my car and decided to commute by train while it is fixed, i thought that it couldn't possibly be as bad as id heard from friends but just to be sure i decided to get on a earlier train. despite this i was made late for work DAILY over a 2 week period. not a single time in 2 week was southern rail running on time, sometimes i was made more then a hour late for what would be a 8 mile drive. it would have been quicker to cycle to work. in the end i decided that this was not worth the stress and simply purchased a new car rather then dealing with the torment of southern rail.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-08-09T21:53:28Z	Worse than a Burma railway	What an absolute farce. 14 hours from Victoria to Bognor Regis due to No trains. No train crew. Diversions and I ended up in Brighton at 11pm with no way to get home. Then I had to buy a new ticket to get to Bognor because my ticket was for the previous day. I applied for a refund and never got one. This crappy government needs to intervene and the board all be held to account. I should have walked. CRAP COMPANY. BADLY RUN.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-08-09T21:53:28Z	Southern Failway	Like many, I have been using a variety of diffrent rail services with southern being the worst. I work a 9-5.30 office job and usually commute around an hour each way. Not with southern rail though as most the time I get home at 8pm. One example recently all trains were canceled on my line at london bridge, with no staff knowing what was going on. One reccomended going to victoira (obviously it was my presence delaying the trains). Once we finally set of, we stopped dead for around 30 mins. This became a regular occurence. I eventually got home in the quick time of 5 hours. Whats annoying is that this problem is not with the staff we see on a daily basis (they seem to do the best job they can while taking all the flak) its the managers and the directors who are on a completley diffrent plane of incompitence. I know people who can run rail mangement software with 4000+ services without one being late its an ABSOLUTE joke. And all we get is a sozm9 from the bosses. Claiming a refund is a joke, got a monthly or yearly ticket, here 90p for the 5 hours delay. Oh and I look foward to the ticket costs increasing next week, because I really want to award this rail company for its excelent service and policies.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-08-09T21:53:28Z	No service and impossible refunds	With a service passengers can no longer rely on and an infuriating refund policy, Southern get my vote for the worst public transport company I have used in 30 years of commuting. Well done Southern, I hope you're proud.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-08-09T21:53:28Z	What are we waiting for before something is changed	Everyday traveling on southern to London has been a nightmare. The service is always late and everyone seems to have taken it for granted that a journey advertised as 30min will take about 50 in real time. Last evening, just before my stop, they said the train has to go back a station after waiting midtrack for 15min. The driver didn't open the doors at the previous station and we stood 15 more when he announced we'll be going back 2 more spots - that's when I stopped listening. How can this be so mismanaged and unplanned. I pay just as much as any London commuter but the service is so terrible I want to move. Most station staff and passengers are disgruntled and these days I end up seeing/hearing at least one altercation everyday at the station due to train delays. What  are the authorities waiting for  before drastic measures are taken and the condition improved?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-08-09T21:53:28Z	A JOKE!!! Only reason there is one star is because it won't allow you to leave a comment without selecting at least one star!	DISGRACEFUL train company. Website won't allow a negative rating and that's purely just because if it did the webpage would crash as result of all the comments that would be left on here! You shouldn't be allowed to continue running this farcical of what you call a service. We pay a fortune to TRY and use the service of which there isn't any. You're blatantly stealing from us! You should be ashamed!!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

(Not allowed to publish a link, but go to their site and click on daily performance report)The management at Southern couldn't run a bath. And don't play that industrial action line, other train companies have problems, they don't subject their customers to this level of misery.btw - I only gave one star because there is no function for a minus score	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-08-09T21:53:28Z	One star is too much	I am so suprised that the British Government doesn't step and do something about this company. Their service is a joke. I have heard about people who have lost their jobs, people been late for interviews, peoples missing important appointments and the list goes on and on. It is a disgrace that you demand your customer to pay so much money for a non-excisting service. I know that all companies can have a bad day where everything goes wrong like the Monday a couples of weeks ago. However there is cancellations and delays every day now. Just this week the train has been on time once in 5 days. Getting home on time to either Tadworth or Tattenham Corner is a joke and I don't think that it is ever going to happen. If the service doesn't get better within the next couple of weeks, then I will be joing South West Trains from Epsom instead!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2016-08-09T21:53:28Z	Southern Railway. WORST SERVICE EVER	Worst experience of my life travelling on Southern Railway.I dont know how on earth they are hanging onto their franchise. Its high time it was taken off them. One day travelling back from London Victoria, train terminated at Haywards Heath. Told the next service to Eastbourne is over 35 mins LATE only for THAT to terminate at Haywards as well. Then told to go to Brighton. The following day was exactly the same except we only made it as far as Gatwick. The service is a JOKE . Little wonder all staff are off sick with stress when the management couldn't organise a 'binge drink in a brewery. ' I say, strip the company of the franchise. Hand them a massive fine, then name and sack every manager !!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-08-09T21:53:28Z	The garbage railway company, almost a liar thief	You have absolutely no possible travel schedule when you take the train of company, because you do not know how long it will takes to travel, the train will stop running at any time, at any time, will be canceled at any time, you need to be patient and waiting for the signal and to listen  to broadcast. even though there are  a few stops, you may be asked to wait for half an hour or an hour.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-08-09T21:53:28Z	they should be taken to court	This company MUST be held to account, for all of the extra expense I have had to take on, and all of the delays and cancelationsYet the government will do nothing about it!!!WHY?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-08-09T21:53:28Z	Have i got a story for you...	Well I bought a monthly season ticket for 460.10. Yes thats right 460 quid! but thats only the start. So it stopped working on the london terminals (it must have been bendy) So like anyone i went to the ticket office to get this re printed. What does the ticket person do? she takes it off me and states that the railcard is not valid proof of owning a monthly ticket, and for this reason she wouldnt give it back! your talking halfway through the month so like £250 worth!! that she wouldnt give back. I said well thats how it was sold to me? how is that my fault? only to be told sorry but you need a password when purchasing these. I refused to move like any other person would who was about to be significantly out of pocket due to the incompetance of southern railway. After kicking up enough stink and not moving for Britain (about an hour) i was eventually given it back but boy did i have to fight it. which poses the question. DO YOU PEOPLE KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING HALF THE TIME? not impressed.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2016-08-09T21:53:28Z	Unreliable, late, unplanned, red tape	I moved to Croydon about five years ago where sadly southern is the only train available. There has been a crew sickness notice on national rail for  months which means I've had experiences standing in a sedentary train at London bridge (not some remote station)  for 30-40 minutes with fellow passenger hanging on to every post available waiting for the driver to show. The last time this happened was at 7:50pm when I was returning from work rather late as I'd  arrived late that morning, again due to trains running late and chaos at every stopping station with passengers trying to get on but no space left. This has been the case for ages now and I've chosen to write this as I hope for change. Someone with some authority needs to step up and fix this.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-08-09T21:53:28Z	Pathetic and appaling	A terrible service that is getting worse by the day. They impact people's lives without care or accountability.  An utter disgrace the whole management team should be replaced and never be allowed to run anything ever again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-08-09T21:53:28Z	Terrible!	I've been traveling on Southern trains now for over 5 years and nothing has changed. Outdated smelly dirty trains, constant cancellations which are distressing especially when your southern train is a connection, delays, strikes and increasingly bad service. I would say avoid but unfortunately we're stuck using this dreadful excuse for a company. The drivers never turn up. I once was told the driver had packed up early for the day to go home and have his dinner, so I had to get on a 50 minute train back home and try to do my journey the next day. Constant disregard, lazy drivers and twisted money grabbing company that also owns Brighton and Hove buses that has increased it's prices 50p every 4 months for the last 3 years. Using Southern railway is a stressful experience, expect delays and cancellations and prepare to not reach your destination.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

First rains in the morning cancelled or delayed. I use this service most days and it is a nightmare.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-08-09T21:53:28Z	Not Fit For Purpose	I just dropped my son at coulsdon south, and guess what, two trains in a row 'delayed'. They were both showing as 'on-time' on the web just before we left for the station. Almost every time we have tried to travel with Southern recently the train has either been cancelled or delayed. What an utter waste of the fair-paying public's time and money. The franchise should be withdrawn from this completely useless company.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	Appalling service..no longer a train company	I have used this company to commute to work for 10 years. I pay nearly£ 3000 pa. The service has always been bad but has deteriorated to the point that it no longer can be called a train company. I travel.from portsmouth to Barnham. Every evening my train is cancelled. Today all five trains in an hour and a half slot were cancelled. I had started to keep a record of the cancellations affecting just the Times I travel to and from work . In one 10 day period 40 trains were cancelled in that small window of time. The trains to London victoria now rarely run . This is a disgrace. The impact on people's lives of this chaos must be astronomic. I have had to cancel peoples job interviews, people have missed specialist medical treatment and so it goes on. The trains that do run on this line are the old london overground trains which I think are now 40 years old and disgusting..I have photos to prove it.  Parts of sub Sahara Africa have better trains. I understand the government minister responsible is unsympathetic to travellers and simply says that interfering when the company are trying their best would just make things worse. Well I know what to do.now at the next election!! I fear that there will be public disorder soon such is the growing anger and frustration. Southern railways - you are a joke please get out of my life and let a proper train company take over.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	Friendly staff and on time trains	Last week I went to seaford from Newhaven with my two kids and my son loves trains and waved at the driver as the train was coming towards us. As we got off at seaford the driver got off to get back on at the other end to travel back to brighton and asked if my son wanted to see here the driver sits! Of course my son said yes and even got to press the horn! The driver even asked me if it was ok to pick him up to put him on the seat. I was very impressed and the driver was such a nice man. You don't get many people who would take time out of their schedule to do this. Also the trains are always on time and I've never had a problem using them. Would recommend to anyone.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	5
2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	This is the worst service ever	They always cancel trains and delay for over 30 minutes save yourself pls use the tube this is terrible I write this as I sit in balham station waiting for over 45 minutes for a train to London bridge this happens everyday am going hone its horrible	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	Unbelievable !!!	"Let me start by saying I'm not a person who complains about this type of thing and in fact this is the first time I ever have ! And even 12 hours later I'm in despair with this joke of a service provided by Southern. I've been telling friends and family for a long time now how bad this company is and I just wonder how bad it has to get for the government to step in . My journey home from work every evening is filled with trepidation . I join my train at Clapham junction only 1 stop down from where the train starts its journey. Every evening trains are cancelled, late or seriously overcrowded. I've lost count of the number of times I've let a train depart because I just cant get on it because of overcrowding. A seat at this time of night (10-11pm ) is a luxury. I only travel one stop down to East Croydon but I'm often over an hour or more late . My wife even questions me now and asks "" what's going on "" las Im always late home lol !! I feel it's only when something bad happens and they investigate how many people are crammed into this poorly run service that anything will ever change. Just how bad does it have to get before the Government steps in ? (Fatalities????) Because I can't imagine it any worse than this shambles of a company! Sorry this review is so long , must be therapy of some kind lol !!!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	Miserable Service	A consistently awful service from these thieves over many years. My most recent experience involved a blatant refusal to sell me a return ticket at the lower price advertised on their website - £56.50 on the website, £81 in person - with no explanation why this was the case. Criminals.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	Terrible	I've been using Southern to commute to and from London for years it's far and away the worst service I have ever used and I'm shocked that's it's become even worse. Trains constantly late and the new excuse crew shortages and Conductor sickness is just a joke.  Southern should lose their franchise worst rail company in the UK.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	Ridiculas to the subline	Southern Rail are cancelling services on the back of staff sickness and dismiss the bad service as the norm. Also customers are not being informed of route changes. I booked the 11.17 to Victoria in advance only to be told that the service terminates at Haywards Heath? When I boarded the delayed train, the driver proudly announced that the would go to Victoria. Also, the ride quality was very bad compared to my onward journey to Birmingham.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	2
2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	If I could give less than one star, I would	"They've really gone downhill over the last couple of years or so. Trains now frequently delayed by ""temporary lack of train crew"", late-running or cancelled services. Drivers are called to their train over the tannoy at London Victoria. Trains arrive at a platform with less than the expected number of coaches, so passengers are squeezed in the carriages. Sometimes it's so bad you just have to laugh. How did it get like this?"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	You may as well walk.	I've only been using this rail to commute into Brighton for a short while, and it is probably the worst experience I've had with trains. In fact it's so bad I've decided not to continue working in Brighton. Nearly every day there is a delay or cancellation, and it is total pot luck if you get where you want on time. In fact it's so bad that the government should probably intervene and force a sale. I think maybe the company is run by 3 year olds or by people so corrupt that it cannot be run at all. I'll be glad to never use them again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	Useless!!!	Simply I would be embarrassed if I managed this company. Always cancelled. Always delayed. Never reliable. I wish we had another choice of train service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	2
2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	Awful customer service and consistent delays	Travel on Southern Rail every week and there are consistent delays on the trains. There are also frequent cancelled services. Avoid travelling with this company if possible.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	Lost Proprerty	Travelled on both Southwest & Southern Trains one evening making my way home. Left my work folder on one of those trains. Southern conveniently have a number you can call to check if it has been found and an online forn, with very helpful staff. Southern have no number, just an online form. I called customer service and got no service. I was told it would take two week to hear anything back and I have no way to follow up? That is rediculous and Frustrating.What pisses me off even more is that the staff on the platform, who are supposedly there to assist you, look and sound bothered when you seek information from them and totally uninterested.

2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	The Rail Company that hates its customers	Southern Rail:From December 2105 - April 2016 - my trains have been on time 40% of the time.I have put up with congestion = trains braking down in the morning causing problems for the rest of the day !No drivers = Allegedly Southern are training 250+ new drivers, however, they seem to be taking forever to finish their trainingSignalling issues = a favourite excuse - which happens every other day Trespassing = supposedly people trespass on Southern Rail lines every dayEngineering Work = the most dreaded excuse of them all, I get a train from Burgess Hill on the Brighton - London Line  and I would guess that over 60% of weekends there are no trains due to engineering works, the worst thing about this is that you are forced to use the bus replacement service which doubles or trebles your journey ( be aware that you still have to pay the full train price to travel on a bus)The website = Unbelievably the recently redesigned website is worse than the train service - totally unacceptable and designed to force commuters to pay the highest price.Customer Service / Twitter = Appalling Delay / Repay = Pathetic process which can cost more to utilise than the minuscule refund they are prepared to payMy advice: DO NOT book a ticket with this company if you want to reach your destination on time.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	Southern railway are s**t to put it bluntly.	"Southern railway are the worst service i have ever used in my life, so unorganized they couldn't arrange a p**s up in a brewery. I use this service daily as my commute to work and every day im faced with late running trains and even cancellations because they ""don't have the staff"" why they expect me and many other customers to pay such a vast amount of money for a service that my 7 and 4 year old sister could run better is beyond me. I wouldn't mind so much if it wasn't for the fact that im now having to get a train AN HOUR EARLIER just to get myself to work on time, it's a f***ing joke. Sort your s**t out southern, and believe me when i say if this carries on the way it's going, ill be seeing you in court very soon, because I refuse to have my job put on the line because of a bunch of incompetent pricks like yourself.

2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	The Un-Smartcard	After persevering for 2 months I gave up after many phone calls to customer services and a Smartcard customer services that does not work after 5pm. The card loaded once and cost in telephone calls is not worth the hassle. #AVOID	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-06-16T22:41:35Z	Complete Lack of Customer Service	I have been using Southern trains for almost 15 years to get between London and Brighton.  So, so many times, whether announced well in advance or not, there are ongoing engineering works which result in me having to take a route which is at least twice as long.  Sometimes, this has involved a bus journey which only takes me about a third of the way home.  Of course, this costs the same as the already highly priced direct journeys I should be able to take. In addition to this, I have lost count of the amount of times when my Hunsband or I have missed a connecting train because the same trains are always late.  Why say they are expected at a certain time when that is almost never the time in which they arrive?Worst of all, Southern then claim that over 90% of their trains run on time because, apparently, it's still on time if it arrives within 5 minutes of its ETA.  I'm pretty certain that if I turned up 5 minutes after my shift started, this would count as late.The final blow, however, is that I made a complaint to Southern in late January, being promised by an automated response that I would receive a response within 20 working days. Almost 3 months later, I have sent 3 follow up emails and have still received nothing. This shows a lack of commitment towards ensuring high quality of service; and it also shows a total lack of respect for the customer and the needs thereof.  It makes me sick, therefore, to have to give them my hard-earned money, to get rubbish service and disrespect from a company who have had loyal business from me and can't even be bothered to acknowledge me.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2016-03-27T13:54:44Z	Terrible service	Trains are late or get cancelled on a regular bases, usually due to crew shortage.

But then, of course, I have been buying full price fares since December. Is there a reason for their not fixing the issues??

Had to re-register with a different email address as they wouldn't migrate my password. They require you to choose a particular train before you see the prices on offer for different times - why can't we have the nice list of trains and prices as before? and as on the highly useable Virgin Trains East Coast site, on which you can buy Southern tickets at a good price and collect them from your Southern station. There's plenty more that I could say - not storing your data and journey history, navigation hopeless, imperfect price info ....

2016-03-27T13:54:44Z	Needs massive improvement	Southern Rail is overpriced, overcrowded, understaffed, lacking vital investment for improvements, and delayed or cancelled more often than not for unacceptable reasons, like signalling failures. How many times do signals need to fail before you get a better system?The updated website is abysmal. The old design was getting on a bit but it did what it was meant to do. Now, it's next to impossible to order the train ticket that you want. The website doesn't show the cheapest and most flexible options, and it's difficult to navigate.There should be a Watchdog investigation into this, because the customer is getting a poor deal by Southern Rail not showing all available options, including the cheapest and most flexible ones.A workaround to this is to order your train tickets online from another train company, like South West Trains, for example. Their website is much easier to use and you can still collect tickets locally.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-03-27T13:54:44Z	Impossible web-site	Can anyone actually work round the new web-site?  In fact, does the designer actually use it?

The new (improved?) site will not store my details so I have to input them all every time I buy a ticket. When I called and queried this I was told it was because of Data Protection!!  Do you really think we are that stupid? It will not give a ""Travelcard"" without me putting in fictitious departure and return journeys.  But hey,  I get to see a map that takes up 3/4 of the screen for a journey I have done hundreds of times.   Did the WEB DESIGN TEAM actually try to use it?Whoever decided that the NEW website was fit for purpose and authorised its implementation should be fired.  Useless, time wasting and pathetic!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2016-03-27T13:54:44Z	Worst Web Up(Down)grade ever	Like others, have been using website for years. Ticket buying section was always good if rest of if could be frustrating. The new one is so poor that I now just have to join the queue at the ticket desk - completely the opposite outcome you'd expect on the back of their policy of reducing staff. Why do you think we need to see a map of where we are travelling to and from instead of being able to see how to buy a damn return ticket?As it is Southern, I need to use the Delay Repay section a lot. Now you can't log in so have to keep reentering your data. It feels like an ongoing deliberate ploy to ensure they don't pay out too easily.Sad really, because their trains and crew are generally good for those of us using them 200+ days a year.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2016-03-27T13:54:44Z	The worst train company know to man	Southern Rail is an absolutely dire and dysfunctional company. I do not exaggerate when I say that the majority of it's trains are delayed, and frequently so overcrowded that you can't have a seat. I understand Southern Rail was taken over by a company in the summer 2015, and seems to have subsequently sacked most of it's employees- resulting surprisingly in them not having enough staff to drive it's trains. I met a train driver for southern rail at barnham train station on my way home (due to an unexpected cancellation by southern), and he didn't know when the train he was supposed to be driving would arrive! I mean, really, how can a train driver not know when the train he's meant to be driving will turn up?!.. I've never experienced such a shocking lack of organisation in a company. They no longer reply when I submit a 'delay repay' form either- no doubt this is due to there being a shortage of staff to respond to my claims.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2015-12-19T21:27:18Z	southern's useless web page	Totally impossible to sign up to the web page although , from the comments of others, that is probably just as well.  Used the old one for years with no problems.  Tried everything to log in to this one.  Their advice - I can still but tickets at the station!  Why can't we just have the old, working web page back?  Southern used to be ok but it has gone to the dogs in the past year.  Still got decent drivers and conductors - must be awful for them.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2015-12-19T21:27:18Z	Totally RUBBISH new website	I use Southern a lot to travel between Portsmouth and London. The new website is a total disaster. Extremely user-unfriendly. Most of the page is taken up by a map which adds nothing to my experience as a customer. The process of booking tickets has become much more confusing and good value tickets are extremely difficult to come across now. And the confirmation email which used to contain useful information such as the train time and reference number is now just a useless piece of electronic rubbish. I really resent paying money for this mess of a train company which cannot provide a basic service and is a disgrace to British railways.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2015-12-19T21:27:18Z	Unbelievably bad	Just when you thought the service couldn't get any worse, they introduced a new website - and it did! The old one worked fine. Now it's a mess to find anything, you have to print off forms and send to cancel a ticket, it doesn't retain personal details properly so you have to type in each time... And still running four-carriage trains from London to Brighton with people packed in wherever possible and standing all the way. This really is a third world service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1

2015-12-19T21:27:18Z	Not possible to buy tickets on the Internet,,,	It seems incredible that, in this day and age, it is not possible to buy tickets on the Internet to use on Southern Railway. They have a website, but it does not work. They used to have a website that DID work, very well, and you could collect tickets from the station ticket machine very easily. Now, you have to go to the station and queue up to buy tickets. In 2015. Incredible. I have tried to call their Customer Services but have held on for exactly 23 minutes..... and have really too much else to do.On my last visit to London, my train was delayed two and a half hours. I did eventually get a refund of that part of the journey but it took one month to receive it after applying.I rarely complain about things, because problems sometimes happen in life, but it seems to me that Southern Railway operates to a standard circa 1975 in terms of both technology and service. Not being able to purchase a ticket online is positively antiquated in 2015.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2015-12-19T21:27:18Z	TOD doesn't work	I booked a return ticket from London to Manchester and when I tried to collect it the machine said it was unable to process the request.  Staff in the ticket office tried and had the same problem.  I phoned Customer Services and they said the quickest way to resolve the problem would be to cancel the ticket and rebook.  I rebooked the same journey (and by this time it was too late to get a seat reservation) and when tried to collect the tickets I had exactly the same problem.  I see another reviewer, Graham Bryce, reported this problem at the end of October but it has clearly not been fixed.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2015-12-19T21:27:18Z	Why don't they allow a Zero star option?	"The first website in the history of the world that makes you spend 15 minutes trying to find times and schedules, and then refuses to accept payment by credit card or debit card (even those that it had accepted for years before the upgrade), and I'm sure there are other methods of payment that it refuses to accept.If I ran my publishing company the way they design their website, I'd be out of business in six months.My previous review:  New Website is an Absolute HorrorSorry I'm having to pull my punches here, but I do want the review to be posted.There is a concept obviously alien to the designers.  It's called ""Beta Testing"", with naive users to be useful.  Let me repeat slowly, ""Be-ta Testing.""The new Southern Railway website is cute.  Is clever.  It is abundant with useless information.  Why am I forced to waste bandwidth on a route map that I couldn't care less about?I have not seen so much screen real estate wasted since the earliest days  of html.  A clear example of retrograde evolution.The amount of clicks and navigation required to see even basic information summaries ludicrous.And to not have seamless migration of your passwords! Shades of Allan Scherr!WHAT exactly were their designers thinking?  Or, having been a software trainer in India, do I suspect that they outsourced their coding?I do hope they have severe clawback provisions embedded in their contract.The old website might not have been the most user friendly or the fastest to load, but the information summary pages were fairly concise and information dense. Navigation was very straightforward.Once again, what were they thinking?  Southern is a TRAIN company.  They don't need their website to be a pale imitation of Facebook. They need it to facilitate their customers' ticket buying experience.ClydeA once satisfied and now extremely dissatisfied customer who spends hundreds if not thousands of dollars on Southern Railway."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2015-12-19T21:27:18Z	Shocking new website	I'm comfortable reporting that the new much-trumpeted beta version is worse in every respect than the existing site. In summary, it's slow, buggy and worst of all, it rips off the ticket-buying public.Here are seven reasons why it's worse:1. It forces you to pay more for a ticket. Buying a ticket, for example, from Lewes to Sutton costs £39.20 direct but the site only offers a London Travelcard at £55.30, which is £16 more expensive. Others I know have encountered this and might have paid far more had they not queued at the ticket office – so lengthening already over-long journey times.2. It's inconsistent: when buying a ticket from Lewes to Sutton (SUO) and specifying a journey starting during the rush hour, it seems to offer a ticket but pressing the continue button then results in an onscreen offering of a ticket for a train at 1642, accompanied by a message that earlier trains are unavailable. It's then impossible to buy the ticket you want.3. It's seriously buggy. It frequently throws up an error after refusing to offer a ticket that I want, which on more than one occasion has crashed my browser.4. It's slow (like Southern's trains), much slower than before.5. It forces the buyer to select a train service where before this was optional, but it may be that the exact journey time is unknown at the time of buying a ticket. This may not matter when buying an off-peak ticket but it is not at all clear that the ticket you buy would be available on any off-peak train, so causing confusion.6. It's wasteful of screen space. What exactly is the point of the map? By definition, I know where my destination is because I'm buying a ticket to go there. The map is pointless.7. When specifying a journey, it still isn't smart enough to automatically move the return journey date to at least equal that of the outward journey if the journey is a day or more ahead.How could Southern have released this ghastly mess on paying customers? They must re-instate the old ticket-buying system until this has undergone extensive testing and is properly fixed.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	2

2015-12-19T21:27:18Z	Southern Railway - Couldn't run a tap	I frequently travel around England on the rail network due to work and I can honestly say that this joke of a TOC should be brought in front of the regulator to explain their extremely shocking performance. Cancelling trains and non existing customer service seems to be the vision of this company. I'm sure there was an item in the franchise agreement with regards to opening ticket offices?If you manage to spot the rare species known as a conductor be wary, as customer service is not their job! As I was advised by one of them. (By the state of his appearance and the trade union badges on his lapel I presume he must have been an engaged staff rep!)You have been consistently failing in your commitments and should have the franchise revoked.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2015-12-19T21:27:18Z	Dreadful company	It's difficult to know where to start!I've had ticket inspectors march me from a train because although I had a valid ticket (on my 'so called' Smartcard) their equipment failed to read it. When it was finally read correctly I received no apology - unless a grunt counts.I've bought tickets online (on at least 3 occasions in 6 months) that have failed to load to the Smartcard forcing me to buy a 2nd paper ticket to enable travel & then have to post a refund application & wait WEEKS for a response & a refund.  No other company I have dealt with, and purchased products from online, is unable to refund online. When speaking to customer services I've been told I cannot speak directly with those who deal with the Smartcard (The Key Team) & also told that they have no supervisors??!!!!The new website is APPALLING!  Every time I log on to buy a ticket I have to re-enter all my personal information again.All that before I get into the filthy trains and cancellations!If you are lucky enough to have another option then please, PLEASE, travel with a different company!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2015-12-19T21:27:18Z	Beware the New Website - with an update  !	I've used Southern's website over several years to buy tickets  - and by and large it's been fine.  I've even managed to get a refund once (for a ticket sold as 'London Terminals' but which after it was bought turned out only to be valid from London Bridge).  So apart from the odd Trade Description transgression, I've been content.Until last week when I was persuaded to switch to their new website.  Apart from a truly abominable design (where do they find the IT idiots who foist these things on the public) the 'website/collect on departure'  combination no longer works - well not for me anyway.  They sent me an email confirming I could pick up the ticket I had bought  (with two reference numbers on the email rather than one - just to difficult I guess ) and the ticket showed up on my Southern account as available.  But I couldn't pick it up.  Two machines at the station simply said they couldn't process my request. Even the ticket staff at Gatwick couldn't pick it up - and believe me they tried.  It was on their system, but it refused to print out.  Neither they nor I could get through to Southern's customer services and as a result I had to buy a new ticket and claim a refund on the old one.  Oh yes - remember the nice easy web based system for refunding tickets not picked up ?   Not any more.  Now that Southern has got its franchise renewed, all these helpful features have miraculously disappeared.  Now you have to send in a form.  God knows when my refund will appear.  Letters of complaint (but complimenting Gatwick's ticket staff for their efforts)  were sent off that afternoon.The moral is simple.  Until Southern's IT people sort themselves out and their managers are reminded that customers matter, buy your tickets from another train operator.   And given Southern's performance so far, my guess is it'll be some time.If I get my refund within a reasonable time AND an apology AND a believable explanation, I'll repost.   Until then, AVOID.UPDATEGot my money back, a polite and thoughtful apology, a voucher for my inconvenience, and an explanation of sorts, six days after posting off my form. It pays to write directly to someone senior in the organisation, particularly if you've had dealings with them before.  (Otherwise the Southern call centre will tell you it takes at least five working days before they can even confirm receipt of your claim !  I know, I called them.)Anyway here are the explanations (capital letters are mine) -' We recently upgraded our online purchasing software but unfortunately, it’s still going through its beta testing phase, and as with any new product of this type, unforeseen technical glitches OFTEN  occur, for which you have regrettably been a victim of on this occasion.''The problem you’ve noted regarding refunds highlights issues that can occur when competing and incompatible systems are allowed to persist. We must keep up with technological advances and we inherited various older systems that were being used across our departments. The new integrated software, WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED, will surpass the convenience of its predecessors, improving and simplifying the way our company operates in general.'So that's all right then.   If eventually you expect to have a decent website that you as a company can operate more easily, it's quite all right to foist a half functioning 'work in hand' which has not been properly tested on your unsuspecting customers. I reckon it'll take them between six months and a year to sort themselves out.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	2

2015-12-19T21:27:18Z	Communicate and tell the truth!!	"I've been using the trains to get to work a couple of times a week since the beginning of the year, and have, on the whole been pleasantly surprised at the promptness and clarity of the service. However, I have only been going short distances.Unfortunately my experience today (going slightly further on work duties) was awful, and shows real weaknesses in the business. Trains were severely disrupted by a 'service train' breaking down by London Bridge. A 'service train'!! What does this mean? Started in the morning, with trains being cancelled with no notice. This carried on all day, despite being told the service train had been repaired. I tried to pick up my train at Horsham to go down to the South Coast, was running very late...then didn't arrive despite being listed on the display. Announcer said The Bognor Regis train will be arriving soon....30+ mins later a train slowly rolled up, and, despite being told this train was not stopping by the announcer, it did stop! ""Should we get on?"" No one knew so we took a chance! Luckily it was going our way! What a fiasco!! 45 min journey taking about 2 hours (after waiting for my very late connecting train to Littlehampton at Ford!).Please just communicate and tell us what is actually happening, get your fingers out and organise yourselves!  Southern Fail charge large sums of money for a very poor service and obviously cannot oranganise a ####-up in brewery!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	2

How hard is it to change the time on someones online booking?Technology has come far these days.Kindly develop your system.Completely unhelpful robot staff at customer services.

2015-01-27T09:40:26Z	Advanced ticket offers tempt me to keep visiting by train!	We have an excellent rail network from here on the south coast compared to other places I have lived. Train prices can be expensive for business trips from where I live so I tend to think carefully before travelling at peak times, or I travel the night before, as I run my own business. I have purchased several advanced rail tickets with southern and enjoyed some great trips away using the rail network to see friends and family. These journeys have worked out cheaper than I would have paid by travelling by car and I have had fun on my journey reading magazines and enjoyed using my tablet to do some work. I am aware to be very careful with the tickets and paperwork as rail ticket inspectors can be very particular. It is also important to study what route is taken to avoid accidentally going out of the network area and incurring extra ticket costs! On the rare occasion when a family member was too ill to travel with me last year I was refunded my tickets in full one month later, after sending a cancellation form to Southern. This has given me confidence to book ahead online. I hope they keep the good advanced deals going!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	4
2015-01-27T09:40:26Z	Not interested in the slightest about customer service	I have made maybe 10-15 return journeys by train between February and May of 2013, spending over £1000 in rail tickets . These have tended to be at anti-social times or during the day to help keep costs down. All journeys were without incident apart from one.  I either didn't notice that one out of hundreds of pieces of tickets and reservations slips I have been given (why not one for each journey?), one paper ticket was missing - the 1 of 2 or 2 of 2 part of my tickets and reservations combination. Because of this, I was forced to buy an additional £99 ticket by a manager at Brighton Train Station on top of the £44 ticket I'd already bought in March. Staff were was cold and unforgiving in my opinion. I would have stood all the way if it made any difference. The answer I got was effectively 'computer says no'.Even though I could demonstrate via receipts and bank payments (see some attached) a ticket was already bought and by me, it didn't make the slightest bit of difference in Virgin and Southern Railways' eyes. Black is black. White is white. No copy ticket or no letter or documentation will be issued to travel on the rail network. So I had no choice but to cough up more than double what I originally paid AGAIN just to make the 5 hour journey after a long day home. They have refused to compensate me. Charming hey? What about the customer is king and going beyond the call of duty to care for customers.The reservation had my name on it and so does the receipt from The Trainline. No one at any level in Southern or Go Ahead Group seems to care, even though they turn over many millions of pounds every year. What is £100 to them - a drop in the ocean? They want to hang on to it though at any cost. My only offence is being human and human error. People in glass houses should throw the first stone? All they care about is their profits, and on this occasion, the way I have been treated as if I am a criminal or a fraudster, is immoral in my opinion. If you overcharge a customer, you should refund them. If they have paid twice, and they can prove it, which I can, why should they pay twice for the same thing? I can't travel on the 18:20 Euston - Manchester train and also the 19:00 Euston - Manchester train at the same time! They seem to think I can.I feel both Southern are unsympathetic and aggressive in their stance of taking money off a customers (myself) for an innocent mistake. I paid for two journeys that only one passenger could make. How is this right?Southern Railway have a funny way of 'Making Every Journey Better' which is their mission statement.Even Passenger Focus said this: I have been in contact with both Southern and Virgin Trains to see if they would be willing to refund one set of the tickets that you purchased as a gesture of goodwill. I’m sorry to say that they are not willing to do so.  I felt it would of shown good customer service for Southern or Virgin to consider a gesture of goodwill especially as you have made many journeys by rail previously and made an innocent mistake by misplacing one of your tickets. However, this case has mirrored some of the issues discovered in our Ticket to Ride research. This research was compiled by Passenger Focus with data captured through our rail complaints team, highlighting the problems faced by passengers where a genuine mistake has been made. This in turn has then lead to a disproportionate impact upon passengers due to the current limitations of the ticketing system.  Our recommendations to improve the current practices have now been presented to the Rail Industry and we now await their response.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	1
2015-01-27T09:40:26Z	Advance tickets great value ... But why stop offering them at Christmas?	Buying tickets online is relatively easy, even if the website is terrible to use on a mobile device. Advance tickets are also great value, but why do they stop offering them over peak times, like Christmas? There's a quota system anyway, so if they're sold out, they're sold out - what's the difference. Holiday travel may be a money spinner, but I think this is just a little unnecessary. Oh, and those advanced tickets ... really, train guards need to accept them on later and alternative trains whenever there's a cancellation or delay. Making someone buy a new ticket as they're travelling on a different train by necessity is just plain mean.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	3
2015-01-27T09:40:26Z	"Beware the ""Money Back Guarantee"""	"I was mis-sold tickets on the Southern Railway web site for a total of £211 (I searched for ""open return"" tickets but was recommended ""day return"" tickets that were not suitable for my journey). No problem... Southern Railway operates a Money Back Guarantee so that instances like this can be resolved. However:1. I applied for a refund via their web site in late December.2. I sent off the tickets and refund claim form on 28 December and they were received on 2 January (presumably due to weekends and the Christmas break).3. It's now 30 January and despite 3 emails to their customer services, the refund has not been processed. They've had 28 days to process the refund and during that time I've been £211 out of pocket. It really isn't difficult to refund money back to a card and there's no excuse for this delay.Seems like they just take your money and earn interest on it for as long as they can. I don't appreciate having to chase my refund in this way, and for a major company to treat its customers this way is extremely poor.I will not be buying train tickets from Southern Railway again."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southernrailway.com	2

When I asked to speak with another member of staff who I would be happy to present my ticket to, he threatened to throw me off the train and stamped on my foot really hard.

After no correspondence for a few months, I contacted Support. In September, I finally got a response asking for more information. I sent the information in, waited til October to be told the refund couldn’t be issued. I had to give a passive aggressive reply for Support to tell me they would look into it further. Waited til November and emailed in to see if anything had happened. They replied the refund couldn’t be issued because the tickets for the journey was in March.I gave them some slack (probably too much which is my fault for being sympathetic to a travel company during a pandemic where you’re not supposed to travel) seeing as it’s a busy time in the pandemic situation, and I’m not happy that they didn’t tell me the tickets weren’t refundable when I originally applied for a refund and that they then sent me emails implying they were going to issue me one.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2020-11-09T18:29:53Z	Fantastic service	Massive heartfelt thanks to Josh this morning ... my son left his laptop on a train destined for London, on his way to school; by 9.30 the laptop was located! Josh responses very quickly, politely and helpfully. A*++++++ from me!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	5
2020-11-09T18:29:53Z	Refusing to modernise	So somebody is abroad and is travelling to the UK and wants to buy a ticket with this lot. For delivery they give you the option to either post it to a UK address or pick it up from a machine/ticket office at the station. Great. So now you pay by Paypal and because you're not in the UK you can't have it delivered at your UK address so you choose the station pickup option. Excellent. Now we are in the coronavirus pandemic and things change from one day to the next so it turns out you can't come into the UK on the selected date. So now you're looking to change that ticket to a different date. Now the only option to have it delivered is via a UK address which creates a conundrum only they know how you can solve. So you have a relative who can receive the ticket to their UK address and then post it to you so you pick that option. But they don't send you the full amended ticket, they send you an excess ticket which is not valid unless you have the original ticket. Nobody is going to tell you that you have to pick up the original ticket from the machine to use the excess ticket. And if you used Paypal as the method to pay then you cannot pick it up from a machine because there is no provision for that, you have to go to the ticket office and get it from there. But not all stations have ticket offices and they're not open 24/7, not even at the airports!Why on earth can't they just issue an e-ticket for your devices countless other companies do and they use this archaic and convoluted system only they know. Perhaps they can't be bothered.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

""Next station is Castle Scary"" just the tip of the iceberg, get that man a pay rise. His enjoyment of his job is evident and his humour and chirpiness is just what we need in these times."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	5

The train manager Kirsty W. was so lovely and helpful. She even came back to me and said: ""16:19"", to point out when is my next train to Reading. She really made my day. Thank you so much, Kirsty, for your kindness and professionalism. The lost guy in dark blue T-shirt."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	5
2020-11-09T18:29:53Z	Extremely rude GWR staff member at Bristol Temple Meads	Quite alarmed by the rudeness and contempt that is clearly permissible by GWR. Myself and my partner were travelling from Cornwall and needed to make a change at Bristol Temple Meads. Having been on various trains over the course of 5 hours we were understandably rather tired by the time we arrived. We regularly travel so we are used to making changes and we are also familiar with Bristol Temple Meads. I arrived roughly in the area where we needed to catch our next train but was momentarily disoriented and looked towards my partner who was slightly behind me to confirm which platform we needed to be on. I was stood near, but not too close to a train on the opposite platform bound for London Paddington. Suddenly a tall GWR staff member wearing a black mask with short black hair launched himself at me and shouted “where are you going?” In a tone which suggested I am totally devoid of a brain. He was glaring at me so I took a pause as I couldn’t work out why I was being spoken to in this way and for a moment wasn’t even sure whether he was a member of staff owing to his complete lack of professionalism. He continued, again in a mocking tone, “this train will leave in a minute so you need to know where you’re going”, my partner then confirmed where we were headed to which the GWR member of staff pointed at platform 13 where the 2.39pm service to Great Malvern from BTM (the train we required, 23rd October) was arriving into the platform. “That one” he spat, towards my partner. A much more helpful member of staff almost seemed to intervene at this point as if also dumbstruck by his colleague’s rudeness and confirmed what we had just been told. As we went to board the train I remarked “slightly rude, but thank you” as I was disgusted at the way we had been treated. His anger came out of nowhere and we had not sought any help so his presence was a surprise. We would of been grateful for his assistance had it not been brought forward with abrasiveness and contempt. I was hardly holding up the other train as I was nowhere near it and after all, if confused passengers miss their train, that’s their fault, so there was no need for any of his attitude. The situation was compounded by the fact that as our train left the platform and began on its journey we turned to the passenger window and clocked the same member of staff on the platform waving at the carriage and blowing a kiss! Perhaps this was jokingly intended for the driver of the train but as it came so soon after our minor altercation it seemed too much of a coincidence. The action also seemed to be deliberately sarcastic and however you cut it, it’s rather strange behaviour! He clearly has little time for members of the public and is deeply dissatisfied in his role and he certainly should be nowhere near customers. He seemed to be fizzing with anger and attitude so I can only assume we were not the only recipients of his particular brand of charm this afternoon.  I would add I have never had a problem with train staff before and think they do a marvellous job, often under immense pressure. Coming from a customer service background myself I can appreciate that totally. However, I hope this complaint is taken seriously and the member of staff in question (whom, unfortunately I am not able to name) is given thorough customer service training and guidance on how to maintain his composure and control his anger.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2020-11-09T18:29:53Z	Great customer service via facebook	I booked a train ticket via a 3rd party website and the booking stated that seat reservations were not possible. GWR's website however says seat reservations should be made. Contacted GWR this evening via facebook and all quickly sorted - Thanks Josh!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	5
2020-11-09T18:29:53Z	Failure of e-ticketing system, and general competence	Bought e-ticket, which vanished. Got to station, couldn't access it. Spent 30-min waiting for answer from helpline: was told all about the failure of GWR e-ticketing system, advised to buy new ticket and to raise the issue where I would be compensated.6-weeks later, GWR customer services are totally unaware of the issue they were acutely aware of on the day, no refund as yet, and no sense of pwnership or accountability.Can't afford to lose work again in this way. GWR, never again!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2020-11-09T18:29:53Z	More often than not the staff are rude...	More often than not the staff are rude to paying customers such as myself. I actually had one physically try and shut the door in my face today because I had my two small dogs with me and I couldn't carry them both on because of the huge gap between the train and the platform. On other occasions I have been cat called by staff on the way out of the station and charged extra for adult tickets despite at the time being a child because I didn't have ID (who does at 15?)Other than the staff being rude the trains are often packed due to lack of carriages at peak times yet passangers are still expected to pay the full fare.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Forget phoning, filling in the online form or emailing, the only way to get any kind of assistance is via their Twitter feed, though I must say Celia on their Twitter team was a marvel.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	3
2020-10-07T15:24:44Z	This is a curates egg type of company	This is a curates egg type of company, the Passenger Assist Service both on the telephone, on the trains and at the stations is totally excellent. Great helpful, polite and always friendly staff, not afraid to remove passengers from the disabled seats either. That bit is a 5 star operation.However the actual train supply function is very much 1 star. Being very elderly and with one of us disabled we always travel from Weston Super Mare where we live to Paignton paying extra for 1st class travel for the extra space and service. We booked about a month in advance and checked each day to see if there were rail works etc. You can imagine our dismay on Monday 14/09 to find the train we were booked on had disappeared from the schedule and been replaced by one departing about 50 minutes earlier with one change or an hour later with two changes and the journey taking 3.5 hours instead of 1.5 hours. Our local taxi company got us to the staion in time to catch the earlier train and the Passenger Assist staff were very helpful indeed. NO FIRST CLASS until we reached Taunton. Same on the way back FIRST CLASS only for part of the journey. We really loved sitting on Taunton station for 45 minutes waiting for the train, it was only the Passenger Assist staff who kept us going. Why GWR seeing that you are getting money from the Government are you so uncaring of your customers and the damage you are inflicting on the West Country. Our Hotel had had quite a few regular guests cancel as they were unable to book suitable trains.Thank you for the response nearly a month later however over a month ago I had complained to customer services and given them ALL details - nothing back from them at all after 5 weeks.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	3

Beware, GWR deals with Covid Pandemic irresponsibly!!!Currently on the 19:16 train from Exeter St David’s, travelling first class, just to get a bit of extra space and comfort, and in current times, safety, or so one would think.Being comfortable in first class coach L, travellers were told this coach wasn’t currently in use. So basically everyone had to bunk up together in the small part of coach K, making social distancing difficult, whilst the second first class coach was empty!? Train attendant told us this is GWR policy. Unacceptable customer service. GWR urgently needs to review its safety and Covid procedures!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2020-10-07T15:24:44Z	Great Western Expectation	From my experiences I have used GWR for short journeys from Swansea and I do like the 800 but what it's lacking for a 5 star is that there are no buffet cars. Yes I like the blinds, yes I like that there's not toilets and seats and the fact that there's more space and air conditioning makes things much nicer. Shame you can't open the windows like the HST but still air conditioning is good enough for me. But seriously GWR a buffet car is needed.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	4

2020-09-16T08:56:34Z	Utterly chaotic GWR	The ticket buying process would get one star. Their website didn't work and no one answered the phone. When I wrote to complain they asked me to contact them on social media. How dare they assume I use social media?Fortunately Trainline exists and I was able to buy a ticket through them without any problems.The outward journey did not go well. As we boarded the conductor told us to move forward as the train would divide at Plymouth. We walked the whole length of the train to carriage A and didn't find another first class carriage which was annoying as we had paid for first class seats. While waiting for the train to leave I went to the toilet and could not unlock the door by pressing the usual lock/unlock button. I pressed the emergency button but no one spoke to me through the intercom. After a few minutes of waiting I called my husband (luckily I had my phone on me) who came and prised the door open manually. I would hate to be in a real emergency on GWR. Then there  a message was broadcast that the train would not divide after all. By this time the train was moving so we had to walk the whole length of it with our luggage. The conductor was very apologetic and found us seats together. He said the notice board had put up the wrong message. The return journey passed without incident, to my relief. A pity, as ten to fifteen years ago they provided a good service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2

2020-09-16T08:56:34Z	Ripped me off for over a hundred quid	"Their system for rebooking is so archaic that it can't be done without booking a new separate ticket then refunding your old one. I made a small mistake and changed the station to a station that is 600 yards away from the original one. Same price. Apparently that invalidates the refund. Customer service ""couldnt do anything about it"". Completely ridiculous thing to do to a loyal customer.

He was told that he  had to purchase another ticket and ended up paying twice for the same seat on the same train.The refusal of entry in Swindon and then having to purchase another ticket resulted in him missing the 1pm train and having to catch the next train. I find it unbelievable that GWR would knowingly charge a student twice for the same journey!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Advised by station staff to travel to Newton Abbot and catch 16.55 which cost us a further £30 in a taxi. Arrived 16.53 As train arrived however station supervisor Alan and his unhelpful staff would not allow us through the barrier and we had to wait a further hour  for train...great job GWR...never again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2020-09-01T21:21:54Z	Great journey	From the ticket office at Paddington to the ticket barriers at slough, we had an amazing experience. The staff were friendly and hard working.

2020-08-16T04:41:42Z	Overpriced and unreliable	I've used gwr for more than 18months as a commuter Swindon-Bristol. Prices are extremely high and not appropriate to the service given. I had much more weeks with a delay than weeks going smoothly. The refund policies are not fair at all with commuters, probably they are more reasonable for single tickets. Tickets bought in one station might be questioned in another one, expecially regarding the peak/off peak definition, which is not defined at all. The company takes advantage to the fact that they have the monoploly on some fares (not even buses), and the customer is not considered at all. For the same money I could have bought a used car and covered all the expenses to do the commute by car.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

In what could have been a stressful situation with changing train times, seat reservations and with a booking having been made through a different company Brad made the whole thing so much easier and hassle free!

2020-08-05T08:54:04Z	Only Great at Dissapointment	Service is regularly late which is disappointing considering the ever rising ticket costs. Prior to Covid, the service update just cased more unecessary chaos for commuters leaving many of us worse off to either raise ticket prices (by removing split ticket destinations from peak times) or removing some smaller local services all together. Finally it seems like many of the recent changes made, also negatively affect the staff. GWR upper management seems to only care about the bottom line at the cost of their customers and staff. The only great thing about them is their ability to disappoint.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Once it had been found I was immediately emailed with a photograph and I could go pick it up on that day. Not only were professional in their dealings but they handled the matter with great care and empathy. I am extremely grateful.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	5

I found the GWR website very user friendly and easy to navigate. It quickly showed the availability and prices for my chosen dates. I was surprised how good the prices are and indeed GWR are far cheaper than any of the various other sites on the internet. I won’t bother with them in the future and will go straight to GWR to book tickets.I did have a query and needed to contact GWR to seek clarification. It clearly shows how you can contact them using Twitter / WattsApp / Phone or e mail. It states you can use WattsApp up to 11pm so at 9.15pm Saturday evening I sent them a message on WattsApp.I thought I would probably get a reply within a couple of days and was amazed that Josh in their customer service team replied within 30 minutes!!His tone was very polite and he answered my question straightaway. This really is awesome service and the best experience I’ve had from any rail operator. Josh deserves some recognition for sure and thanks to GWR for making it all so easy.

Absolutely disgusting that the level of actual trains is apparently at around 80 percent when my station has 2 trains per day at completely ridiculous times that you can't use for work. Facebook gives you awful generic answers and the timetables are incorrect. If you live north of Oxford then you can't go to work! The country lines are probably the people that need them the most and your company is the only one that stops at my station leaving me no options. Terrible service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Since then I've had only one email from GWR stating my claim number on 05/04/2020. I've had no updates on how long the process may take, not even an apology for the delay! I do understand that this is a difficult time, and there is a backlog in processing claims, however I don't think it's unfair to be updated on what's happening! Everybody's struggling, some of us are about to loose our jobs, every penny is precious! If you just took the time to let people know how there claim is being processed it would ease some of the anxiety and tension everyones trying to deal with at the moment!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2020-06-22T17:20:38Z	Season Ticket Refund Delay	I applied for a season ticket refund on 1st May and have heard nothing since. This may be a small sum to GWR but it really matters to us. I have chased online and over the phone but nothing happens.  Shocking.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2020-06-22T17:20:38Z	Season ticket refund, still waiting....	I applied for a refund on 16th March, 64 working days ago and still no refund of my season ticket. I initially contacted them after the standard 28 days they normally take to reply. Then I was told it would be 56 days. I've tried emailing since and all I am given is excuses and told it has been escalated to finance. I'm even more concerned as some have been asked for card details and as I haven't, I'm really no further ahead than when I started this process in March. Having been furloughed and faced salary cuts, this is already an anxious time, which is being exacerbated by GWR.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2020-06-22T17:20:38Z	Refund requested 82 days ago and counting	"Requested refund on season ticket on 27nd March. Still waiting. Kept being told that the processing time had increased, then that it was passed on to the escalation team for payment within 2 weeks which didn't happen. The escalation team was not responding to being chased for over a week after that, then came up with an issue ""processing"" the payment (whatever the hell that means) which has now been going on for a week. Contacted the complaints department 10 days ago and no sign of life either. Considering that I have been furloughed on reduced pay and that the exorbitant cost of the ticket was covered by a season ticket loan that I still need to reimburse, this keeps getting worse. I'm discussing with my company a WFH schedule going forward so that I don't have to get a season ticket ever again because this experience, in addition to the crowded and delayed trains when they were functioning has been nothing short of appaling."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2020-06-22T17:20:38Z	Don’t book GWR Advance tickets.	In April 2020 I bought train tickets to connect with flights from Gatwick Airport. GWR advise me not to travel as my journeys are not essential. That’s understandable. However as I bought Advance tickets I’m told I am not eligible for a refund. GWR Customer Services staff suggest changing my travel dates to a later date. Unfortunately the 12 week window for Advance tickets has disappeared and is only 8 days after my flight, so pretty useless.I’ve paid for journeys I should not take. I can’t get a refund. I can’t book a reasonable alternative service. GWR have taken my payment and offer no reasonable travel options. Terrible company.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2020-06-22T17:20:38Z	Disappointing	I've now been waiting 74 days for my season ticket refund, and I'm disappointed.  If the GWR Twitter page is anything to go by, I know I'm not the only person that has been waiting a significant period for their refund to be processed. I'm aware that the Refunds Team has received an unprecedented number of requests, but to keep customers waiting for their money for so long, and at such a challenging time, is quite distressing.  People have lost their jobs and have been furloughed - this money could be the difference in someone making their rent payment or buying food.  The lack of compassion and empathy for customers is both astounding and disappointing. Also, I imagine many people with season tickets don't just have £4k+ lying around - they use loan schemes through work to pay for their travel. What if people have been made redundant without paying off their season ticket loan?  Please, please, please have a conscience and give people their money back within a reasonable timeframe.   (The two stars are for the GWR Customer Service team - you've always been helpful.  Your responsiveness and customer care are much appreciated; it makes the silence from the rest of GWR on this matter all the more glaring.)	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2
2020-06-22T17:20:38Z	GWR fails to refund after 67 days	I applied for two refunds from GWR on on 24 March. It’s now 67 days later  there’s been NO refund. GWR have failed to proactively contact me and when contacting them (several times) they’ve given conflicting and woolly responses. Their sole accurate message being that they’re received the claims but they’ve been too busy to refund within the usual timeframe. They say they have had to double it. It’s now nearly two weeks beyond the extended timeframe so that was wrong information . GWR need to understand that their customers have also been impacted by the crisis as well as them. Busy GWR will be. And no doubt fewer staff. Everyone can understand that brings challenges. However the extreme delay now begins to feel like poorly managed procedures at the least,  a reluctance to respect their customers and a seemingly  unwillingness to refund. With such overwhelmingly poor feedback GWR need to improve performance fast.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

I have had an ongoing complaint with them regarding booked seats to which I never got due to a GWR error where they never had enough coaches. The replies I've had from this company are disgusting. They have no care for customers.Be very aware when using or buying tickets from them. The bottom line is they do not want to give any money back even when they are at fault.

2020-03-27T15:56:10Z	Refunds due to COVID19 - they don't make it easy	I was looking to get a refund for my season pass because I can no longer travel due to the coronavirus outbreak. They make it very difficult to get the refund: you have to fill in an online form and you can only get the refund for the period AFTER you fill in the form. For example, my pass is from 5th March to 5th April. I haven't travelled since the 10th of March, but I can only claim the refund from the 27th (today's date) because that's when I filled in the form. Also, they want you to send the ticket in the post, otherwise you cannot claim the refund.Clearly, they are trying to make it as difficult as possible for people to get their money back.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2020-03-27T15:56:10Z	Staggered by their callousness	Emergency situation where a family member (who does not drive) needed to get to the hospital ASAP. No time to buy a ticket at the station due to a queue, but was more than willing to pay the fare on the train. Stopped by a whole team of Revenue Protection Officers and Transport Police at the station who ignored the fact that it was an emergency situation, who also refused the offer to pay a £20 on-the-spot fine that was offered to other passengers without a ticket. Now GWR have sent through an incredibly aggressive letter demanding £85.90 be paid immediately, or else they'll double the fine to £165.90. The original fare was £5.90.Absolutely shocked at the callous and aggressive treatment handed out by GWR, who now seem to be operating more like loan sharks than a rail company. Perhaps their officers could learn a bit of humanity towards a woman who's seriously ill, in future.Oh, and literally every GWR train I've caught in the last few weeks has been delayed. Shocking service all round.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

I'm on a GWR train right now they've said that they don't have enough staff to run the trolley service yet they DO have enough staff to check tickets and I've seen at least 3 different members of the on train crew walk past. For the past two years I've had to use GWR to commute between Bristol and London and for 2 years its gotten gradually worse. I've now actually changed my job so that I don't have to use it as often. I'm now down to once every two weeks and soon I'll be down to once a month! Thanks GWR for scaring me (and no doubt others) away from the southwest with your god-awful train service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2020-03-27T15:56:10Z	The recent timetable changes promised…	The recent timetable changes promised quicker and more frequent trains. We go down fromTiverton toDawlish and Teignmouth a lot. The changes now mean that instead of very frequent trains direct, we now have to change at Exeter apart from an early morning train and one near lunchtime. The journey time has now doubled!The promise of faster trains has been at the expense of less frequent stops -very disingenuous GWR.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2

2020-03-27T15:56:10Z	I have no choice but to use this…	I have no choice but to use this dreadful and rip off train operator.  I would be embarressed to look at the reviews here if I was the MD, wake up GWR !!.  Every train I seem to use either gets cancelled or delayed that I miss my connection at Temple Meads. Forget the Delay / Repay mine got refused despite them cancelling the train !! A cancelled train is a breach of the ticket I brought, not a delay because I got the next train !!  they cancelled the service I was booked on so that's a full refund, just like buying anything when the goods/services aren't fulfilled. Despite the dreadful service, I was stuck in London and thus had to get a morning train back from paddington to Worle, my super saver was not valid and when I asked to upgrade so I could get the earlier train they would only sell me a new single ticket for £118 !!!!  and told i'd have to apply for a refund for the unused super saver !!!  they could have easily have just allowed me to pay the difference, totally unreasonable and the biggest rip off i've ever encountered, how can this ever be justified ? it's an utter scandal !! When I questioned this at the ticket desk, despite their embarresment at the cost, they told it's becasue they prioritise regular business travellers with annual tickets...unbelivable to even suggest this is a valid and fair excuse, the rest of us clearly don't matter.  If it's a peak train in this direction why was it only 1/4 full ??   I would encourage anyone to drive and look to blame the train operators for creating a service so bad and over charging customers at ridiculous ticket costs that the environment impact is on their hands, not yours.  Boycott them if you can, they deserve all they get and their demise will only be themselves to blame. Nationalisation can't come sooner to GWR. I await a copy and pasted reply from Bradley. They aren't interested in improving services, so I don't believe anything they say.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2020-03-27T15:56:10Z	Why is the company still running?	Why is the company still running? One of the very worst train operators in the UK. Now becoming increasingly standard practice to run three standard class carriages London-Swansea: 4 of these of my 6 trips in recent months. Often no apology or explanation, with dozens standing. After months of disruption and claims about improved new trains and more seats, habitually running disgracefully short trains, with vastly less seats, and the seats themselves on new trains infamous for being probably the most uncomfortable in UK. A recent journey with 3 broken toilets, no water in basins, and severe overcrowding would be a tremendous way to help spread the coronavirus efficiently. GWR is almost certainly running these absurdly short trains to avoid outright cancellations, for which it would be financially penalised. The greatest advert for Renationalisation you could possibly imagine. No one would use this company if they had a choice.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2020-03-27T15:56:10Z	Would give 0 stars if I could	Would give 0 stars if I could. Absolutely no thought for parents with young children with their train design. Having to fold down push chairs with sleeping babies is stupid, never happened on the old trains. Clearly you are not the brightest when it comes to train design.Cheers Brad, just been on the return train, didn't fold the pram down, refused to fold it down when asked (your conductor suggested I put my 10 month old on the floor to fold it) but walked away when I told them I wouldnt do it. Didnt get kicked off the train, so most definitely wont be folding the pushchair next time as its clear you cant stop me.GWR should be more accountable and provided buggy areas the same as buses, instead of being so greedy	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2020-03-27T15:56:10Z	Unacceptable for price won’t be using again.	I used this service between Port Talbot and London. On my trip to London the service was extended by 1 1/2 hours due to flooding which was an hour longer than they advised. On the trip back I had this same delay plus another hour delay due to the driver not turning up to work. Tickets for 2 were £180... You just can’t justify these shocking prices when the service is so unreliable and when other countries don’t have these constant issues you simply have no excuse to hide behind. It’s half the price to fly so that will be my choice next time.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2020-02-26T21:44:49Z	Disappointing...	Travelling at the moment from Reading to Totnes 1st class. The 1st class carriage has no proper luggage storage so suitcases have to be stored either overhead ( not practical if your case is large) or by your knees. The seat reservations were all wrong so it was a bun fight to get a seat even though i had a reserved one ( someone else had the same Seat number reserved ). Finally the trolley service is sparse - are GWR trying to skimp by hiding the food away? You have to really push the staff to get them to offer up anything much - just wondering if they are bonused on how little refreshments they can give away!!!Disappointing and not value for money	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2

2020-02-26T21:44:49Z	Symptom of the modern world	GWR trains are insanely overpriced and non-reflective of the true cost of travelling by train. This makes it an elitist experience and inaccessible to those who cannot afford, for example a £100+ train from Totnes to London. I don't get the train much, because I can't afford to, but recently I was fined for trying to buy a ticket on a train, a train I had to get on because I would have missed my booked connection, yet there were no ticket machines or officers on the platform to London, and the ticket officer on the train said it was impossible to buy a ticket on the train (despite making me buy one after issuing the fine).Edit: Thanks Bradley, I have emailed you. But in regards to the railcard reducing the price, yet it does, but not for everyone as not everyone is eligible for one, and my point is the price should be reduced generally, not by getting people to buy railcards to make the train price more 'affordable' (which it isn't, it's £70.00 for a return to London from Totnes with a railcard. It costs less than that in petrol).	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2020-02-26T21:44:49Z	Terrible service from Truro to Falmouth	Frequently late and cancelled with no explanation, this is a terrible service, please can somebody sort this branch line out as it is a complete disaster especially for those who have to rely on it for work.

2020-02-26T21:44:49Z	Management should be ashamed	The service on the Cotswold line to London Paddington is consistently dreadful. Trains are frequently cancelled, and when they do run their punctuality is woeful. As an illustration, out of the last seven journeys on the 8.27 Charlbury to Paddington, two were cancelled, two were more than 20 minutes late and none arrived on time.  I don't want to have to drive to Oxford Parkway, but when I do I'm always impressed by the fact that Chiltern trains arrive when they should and invariably reach London on time. It's an example of what can be done. Chiltern doesn't seem to suffer from the 'shortage of train crew' which GWR so often uses as an excuse to cancel a service.  (Chiltern also runs long distance trains from Birmingham and other Midlands stations which also have a strong reliability record). If anyone from GWR replies to this please don't tell me I can claim compensation.  I don't want compensation which, in any case, doesn't cover the stress and disruption. I just want a reliable service.  I hope that when it's time for a franchise review, GWR's record comes under close scrutiny.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

No day passes by without at least one of those: delays, platform alterations, cancelations. Or combinations of those. In periods of particular long commute and stress, they have the ability to make it even worse, e.g. you leave work 1 hour before to get some good rest at home, and you end up wasting 45 mins stuck somewhere on the way back. I can't explain to myself how it's possible that nobody protests or forces these incompetents out of the market.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

A restaurant on wheels perfect for seeing our beautiful countryside.My partner and I were engaged at Dawlish Station on her Birthday, Sunday Januaty 19th.GWR saw our photos taken by Jimmy, Alex and Kerry, who were simply brilliant, so friendly, they even made us a cup of tea and spoke to us for approx 2 hours.GWR Head Office subsequently offered us the opportunity to be their guests on the Pullman Service & an extra treat the Night Riviera Sleeper from Penzance back to London Paddington.Matt at Penzance again was brilliant, very friendly and made us feel so welcome.The train crew on the 13:04 from Paddington to Plymouth were exceptional, so much praise for them, attentive, professional and so friendly, Cristina, Ryan and Teresa to name a few, all staff were brilliant.The sleeper service (2145 Weds 12th, Penzance to London Paddington) again was excellent, staff were lovely, especially the Lounge crew and Train driver Simon.I feel passionate myself about customer service and the ability to care for your customers whatever the age group.GWR were and are amazing, a family feel like company and amongst all the negative comments on reviews and social media spare a thought for the dedication the staff have to offer.Take time to compliment, few too many do, when a train is late negativity surfices.Thank you so much GWR for creating a memory for Alexandra and I to cherish forever.To all at GWR ""Thank you"" inparticular Dan & John"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	5

2020-02-26T21:44:49Z	I'm not a peice of trash	Today was the first day I have used the train in 3 years. Because my car was being repaired. I tried to download your app to buy a ticket but it wouldn't let me register my device to receive a e ticket. I arrived a few minutes before my train and there were ques for the ticket machines. I asked the barrier man if I could purchase a ticket on the train that was 1 minute away. He said no. I said that makes no sense, he looked at me like a peice of trash and said it makes perfect sense. So I qued to purchase a ticket and missed my train. Then I went back through the barrier and said Thank you to the barrier man for doing such a great job. And waited for the next train to arrive. It arrived late I got on and took my seat and a few minutes later the conductor came around to check my ticket, then he said I had purchased the wrong one at the station I literally just got the ticket from. And said he had to charge me more as the price was off peak. (I asked the ticket office for the next train to chippenham please). I then went onto the gwr website and showed him that I could buy the ticket right now online for the same price for the journey that I was on and he eventually gave up.Now finally I was alerted that you stated that I saved the planet by cutting my c02 emmsions. This is not true as my dad had to drive 1hr 10mins to pick me up and take me home from the station and my friend who dropped me off had to drive for 40mins. Total 1hr 50mins in driving. It takes 1hr 20mins to drive from my house to work and costs £10. Unless you get the train then it takes 2hr 30mins And costs £14.40 just for the train. Please can you refund me and plant a couple of trees.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Clearly NOT designed for the comfort of the customer on a long journey.  Hard, and rigidly upright, Fine for commuter trains.

2020-02-26T21:44:49Z	Unfair	I have just tried to get on the 17.53 At 17.53 might I just add, train from Bristol temple meads to Weston Super Mare. I got to the Front of the train as it was still on the platform with the doors still open. 10 Meters in front of me a women was allowed on as the guy waved her on. He could see I was coming as well not far behind her and shouted NO ! Shook his head and waved his hands to say your not coming on. Got on the train shut the doors and I was stood in front of the door whilst the train was stationary and then 10 seconds later left the platform. Surely if I wasn’t allowed on the person in front of me shouldn’t of been allowed on or did that guy just really feel that if the train went 5 seconds later it would of caused a massive delay. I don’t think so!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Note, to go to the Malvern Hills you need to be able to walk up a good few long steep hills and be fine with heights. On the 30/02/20, I had some spare cash available and it meant I only had to spend around £30 on 2 First Class Advance Singles for the 01/02/20 - 10:45 from Oxford to Great Malvern and the 17:40 back.On this line you have 5 or 9-car IET's mostly.

2020-02-07T14:42:58Z	Customer service is a joke.	Customer service is a joke.I booked the wrong day by accident (their online booking system is awful, it resets every time you add a new search parameter), immediately noticed and tried to change the ticket but the amend booking system can't load the 'select seats and extras' page. I spent several stressful hours trying to make that work, eventually sent an email to customer service with the issue. Got an email back a week and a day later, saying absolutely nothing helpful. I've been on hold for nearly 20 minutes and I'm so fed up of all of this. I wish I could take a different train, these train monopolies are disgusting and bring out a complacent side of these companies.Edit after Bradley from GWR replied to this review:Nice to see that GWR can employ people to respond to poor reviews, yet they can't pick up the phone (if you call the GWR customer service desk it forwards to TfL because they don't do it in house apparently).Bradley, love, chum, salt of the earth, do you not see that this is ridiculous? How can I be expected to chase GWR through their website, email, phone, Trustpilot and then to an obscure refund system or a ticket office? This is not how customer service is supposed to work, and this isn't how a consumer should be valued. I would probably be valued more if there wasn't a localised monopoly on every single train line.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

The Cheltenham London journey stops everywhere and a most idiotic 15 minute wait at Gloucester, it should be a 1 hour 20 min journey stopping at Stroud only then Swindon. But no it is 2 hours 10 . In the most uncomfortable seats ever invented. Did anyone actually test these trains ? We are all stuck with them and there is no option, and as a return in first is 200 pounds plus, that is quite some joke GWR are having. Over priced, too slow, and seriously uncomfortable.

2020-02-07T14:42:58Z	3rd World Service here in the UK !!! BOOK NOW !!!	"Great to see that the millions of investment have managed to create a rail service comparable to that of a third world country. Firstly the service route purchased online didnt exist in reality (a good start), then queued until 3 minutes before departure waiting for the platform to be announced....then on announcement a ""Hunger Games"" melee brawl to get a seat. Once on board the train we have the joy of standing room only and passengers moving zombielike through the aisles searching in vain for a free seat as a shade of Hades tormenting the damned.Might I suggest that offering a rooftop option may complete the experience. At the present pricing standards of GWR it is only marginally cheaper than an actual third world holiday so allowing us mere cattle to hang from the roof would allow us complete immersion into the experience. On the plus side, this service offers a top notch educational role, my 12 year old now has an insight, however minute, into the horror trains of the third reich and soviet gulags. The fetid smell of the huddled and disposessed masses felt real and added even more to the experience....Perfect."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2020-02-07T14:42:58Z	5 car trains only beyond Plymouth??	Having just two weeks ago travelled from Cornwall to Paddington and back with the train both joining and splitting into a five car unit to continue their respective journeys I am concerned that later this year you will find some serious overcrowding issues. Bearing in mind the 14:03 service to Penzance from Paddington was well and truly rammed beyond Plymouth in mid January (and this without Plymouth commuters I might add) this must surely prove the point.Whilst I agree that GWR increasing the number of services between Penzance and Plymouth is a good thing on this occasion it had no bearing on the passenger numbers on this particular service. You'll definitely be needing more nine and ten car trains as opposed to five car IET's.I had a seat fine however I was concerned about the use of five car trains during busy periods being a bad idea. I understand that this may be beyond GWR's control.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	3
2020-02-07T14:42:58Z	No seat on train	Reserved 1st class seat from Devon to London. Seat not available as train had been reduced from 9 carriages to only 5. Luckily found a seat in standard class. Drinks trolley came around and i asked for a coffee and showed my ticket, to be told i can not have one from that trolley only the 1st class one and she would tell them to come down. They never came and an hour odd later she came and asked if i had got my drink. I said no but the manager came with a coffee and a sandwich etc. He appologised for not having a seat and signed my ticket to get a refund at Paddington office. It was not his fault and the staff were great in a difficult situation with moaning passengers. Well the ticket machine retained my ticket so i emailed customer services with my recipt details etc and although not arrived yet they are sending a partial refund. I still do not like this so called upgrade to the trains.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	4

GWR's response to a review about the poor service between Maidenhead and Paddington is as follows: ""As part of the development of Crossrail services, 50% of GWR services were transferred to TfL in December and where as there are fewer GWR services, there are not fewer services overall."" If the case is that GWR has transferred 50% of services to TfL then how come GWR rail fares have increased? Further, it seems that we are being penalised with the introduction of more TfL slow trains whilst not having the benefit of the Elizabeth line in central London actually being open (and allegedly only starting in summer 2021).

2020-02-07T14:42:58Z	Best thing ever if you’re a  bus company	GWR’s new Hitachi trains are the greatest thing ever to happen to National Express. The hug speed trains on the GreatEestern network are so awful I would rather endure the extra hours on a bus to avoid the experience. The sterile and cold carriages do not redeem themselves whe you take your seat. The seats are a master lad I torture. Compared by some to sitting  on an ironing board, this comparison is very unfair to ironing boards .The lighting is harsh and bright particularly during the hours of darkness. The carriages wobble and shake, and I have noticed as they age many carriages are developing awful whining noises, although this might be a result of th hybrid motors they decided to shoehorn in at the last minute. . .	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

I have been told to please only contact them through their thread so that messages don't get lost and guess what?  No reply to 3 emails. Expected to hold on to tickets for Reference to problems and what gets me is all the info they require is on assisted travel gwr but they can't get it from them.

They suggested I get in touch via Facebook, Twitter or other social media, none of which I do, to advise them of the case number (are they incapable of performing a search?).

2020-02-07T14:42:58Z	Henley-Paddington service is terrible	10/01/2020Service has been dreadful ever since the new timetable came into effect. I Commute from Henley to Paddington and used to always get a seat and have a pleasant journey. The new timetable now gets me into work and back home later than before, the prices have increased and I am constantly fighting to get a seat. The trains are completely packed all the time. This is ignoring the fact that the majority of the time the service is either delayed or cancelled.There is no consideration for passengers when these cancellations occur. On the 8/01/2020 the 17:51 service delayed so much it wouldn't stop at Twyford. Anybody wanting to get to Twyford decided to take the 18:07 to Frome which arrives at twyford 18:27. The Henley connection train leaves at 18:27. We arrived at Twyford at 18:25, rushed to get onto platform to find staff had blocked entrance to it. By the time we ran round to the other entrance the train started leaving. Staff said they couldn't hold the train because we weren't on the connecting train. Even though the connecting train was cancelled. Somebody working for GWR should have had the decency once they saw all these passengers trying to get on an empty train to hold it for at least 2 mins, to allow passengers to not be delayed by 30 mins. No thought for the people who use there service*****UPDATE (later the same day)******I wrote this earlier today. Funnily enough I arrived at Twyford today from Paddington at 18:28, 1 minute late. Normally there is a 4 min window for connecting trains. Today the train left without us. Absolutely appalling.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

We where delayed and the manager on the train announced that we will all be able to get a full refund for that service. But I only got £6.46 as my compensation which is RIDICULOUS!!To make things worst I was supposed to be getting the 4 o'clock train back from paddington, but it was cancelled causing all the people on that 4 o'clock train and the 3 o'clock train to fit into 5 carriages!!

2020-01-04T11:46:30Z	Intercity... really?	Intercity... really?Had the person who designed/approved these new Hitachi trains ever been on a long distance rail journey?Good news first:There's plenty of legroom in cattle class.The wifi works.That's the end of the good news.The seats are uncomfortable, surely a prerequisite of an intercity train is to have seats you can sit on for more than an hour before your backside goes numb?The electronic seat reservation system hasn't worked on any of the trains I've used since they were introduced. There is no buffet car, a trolley comes around but if the train is packed then by the time it gets to you there's very little, or no choice, of food and the mealtime has usually passed.If you're in 1st class you don't fare much better, it just isn't worth the extra money.The seats are equally as uncomfortable. The effect of putting two trains together to make the 9/10 carriage train means that if you're in the wrong bit then you can't get into the Pullman dining car.The old GWR dining car was good but we've not been able to see if that standard has been superseded on these new thingsYes, yes...

The few times I have travelled I've been met with very indifferent/impolite GWR staff. They are certainly dressed the part, maybe some training in customer service would be money better spent. Extortionate ticket prices, limiting open returns to single 'day journeys' between Chippenham and Bristol (as if you have the right to dictate what type of journey I have), and special rules disallowing Railcards are reasons you will continue to lose customers.Bring on re-nationalisation.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2020-01-04T11:46:30Z	If Fawlty Towers were a railway company...	Not a great start eh GWR?My train home tonight from Reading was sent down the wrong track to Twyford instead of Shalford!The guard, who looked suitably embarrassed, said the train would return to Reading and then set off along the correct route.At Reading, we waited - until an announcement cam that the train had now been cancelled! This left the train-full of commuters (expressing a mixture of anger and incredulity) with a few short minutes to decamp to the other side of Reading station and cram into an already full train to face an extremely uncomfortable journey home.Setting the points incorrectly so trains go down the wrong track may work well as a plot device in a Buster Keaton silent movie, but for a 21st century rail company, it simply beggars belief.Could there have been safety issues?

I felt completely belittled and had to ask a fellow passenger to ask my questions as at least he answered her!That's not all though, last minute calling of trains, I was at the station half an hour before my train, 5 minutes before it's due to depart they call it and again I get smooshed by fellow travellers as they are rushing too.I think I will just park in future and get the tube in as I feel completely let down by the service and you've lost my trust.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2

2020-01-04T11:46:30Z	Why bother with offering	Why bother with offering a weekend service if you cannot staff it? Apparently GWR cannot make staff work Sundays (not sure about Saturdays) so quite often the direct trains from London to Cornwall are cancelled, leaving the poor (paying) customers to jump on another train, stand or sit on the floor, or not bother, which is a real problem if you are travelling with a family or if you are elderly - or let's face it, for anyone going on a long journey. I would love to speak to The person responsible, as this is not a one off, but a regular occurrence, as I know from experience. No other business operate this way. Perhaps they just don't care? I would love a reply, but I don't expect to get one. My advice is do not travel with GWR over a weekend if you want a specific service, or if you are travelling with children, or if you are travelling with elderly people, or if you are going on a long journey. They will really cock it up!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Trains are meant to be new but are incredibly dirty and look like they haven’t seen a vacuum in months most of the time. Whenever you decide to claim for a delayed or cancelled service they just decline your claim and the staff never listen to your concerns. Just try to fob you off with what is clearly corporate scripted rubbish and don’t want to acknowledge their failings as a company.

2019-12-09T23:39:01Z	I rarely use the train but omg never again...	I rarely use the train, but did so as my company had booked me train tickets. Journey up to London from Exeter was decent. Very different story on the return journey. First of all the boards don't work. Train was due to leave at 17:33 and we were told at 17:29 what platform it had. Like cattle all people were running and queuing to make it past the ticket control area. I didn't know that the seat reservations are not working. I am on train for over an hour and still don't know what coach I am sitting in. It's freezing cold in the coach, I mean it's nearly December. The interior of the new trains is very clinical, lights seats etc. To be fair never have seen anything more depressing like this for such a long journey. The seats - - no words for those. May as well sit on stone. And no Brad, I don't need your automated reply to the ergonomically designed seats. I mean Brad is a nice name for computer automated replies. The guy with the trolley barely made it through the isle. And don't even bother trying to sleep on the train. A. The seats will make sure you can't. B. Even if you that exhausted that you don't care about the seat anymore, the noise will keep you up. I am  listening to my music on maximum volume and can still hear the bloody train as an additional baseline to my music. Also no food car or anything. I mean who needs food on a 3 hour journey. Maybe the GWR wants us to loose a couple of pounds. No food car, seats so uncomfortable that you jump from a to b. Anyways what you pay for and what you get is more than appalling. There is no quality to this train or its journey. Considering that I am German, I have seen some really old trains and some really advanced ones in comparison. But no matter the age, always comfortable. Proper seats, plug sockets which actually charge your phone rather than pretending to, plenty of food in the food car and extra bike cars for the people with bicycles. Little advice, we have double decker trains, so you have the same length and actually more seats. Why don't you give that a go if you want to cramm in more seats. Anyway also had much nicer train journeys in Belgium and France as well. I mean my eurostar costs me 39 quid and I get a lot more out of that. So yeah I will use my good old golf and drive next time. Ridiculous quality for a £80 pound ticket.P. S.

2019-12-09T23:39:01Z	Dreadful in all respects.	If you wish to view the sheer idiocy and decrepitude of GWR at its starkest, make a complaint. Yes, there's no shortage of things to complain about: lateness, overcrowding, unreliability, non-operational lavatories, arrogant, vastly overpaid management showcasing their contempt for the passengers on a daily basis. Their complaint avoidance strategy is based on various levels of subtle obstruction: they don't bother to effectively read your email, they keep insisting on information you've already given them, they provide an email address with a tiny capacity in order to ensure you can't forward pictures of your tickets, and they delay for as long as humanly possible.Given the lamentable levels of customer satisfaction displayed on this website, you might expect the Rail Regulator to take action against this appalling company. Don't hold your breath: he/she contentedly purrs away sitting on the broad lap of the railway companies while singularly failing to notice anything amiss. So let's hope Corbyn, if he gets the opportunity, sacks the Regulator and confiscates GWR's network without providing any compensation to the shareholders.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-12-09T23:39:01Z	Better to ride a rock...	Thank you for taking the time to copy and paste your company's terms and conditions as a response to my query. Unfortunately, this did not address the question that I asked, and would therefore like this to be raised as to a complaint.I have previously read your inaccessible terms regarding compensation to season ticket holders. I have also taken a look at your performance tables (I'm not able to paste the URL here), which I understand to be below target. Following this research, I spoke to your station staff about compensation for poor service, but was told to apply for it online. There was no way to do this online, so I got in touch with you, to which you responded by copying and pasting the uninformative terms from your website, and in doing so, ignoring my question.Were you a publicly-owned company, I would have understood your inability to work diligently, but your company is making an obscene amount of money out of the tickets that people like me are buying, yet you take no responsibility for the poor service that you are providing by improving your resources. Your trains are late more often than they are on time, and when they do arrive the service is inadequate for the number of people using it. As you have the monopoly on the service, there is no incentive for you to be diligent, so you continue with your arrogant treatment of the people paying for your big fat shareholders' Christmas hampers.Please, could you inform me how I might get compensation for your third-world service, and when you might improve the service to resemble that of at least that of a developing country's service? If you're not able to take pride in your work, please give it to someone who will.I look forward in hope to a response that isn't regurgitated from elsewhere.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

We made a claim an we’re given a 50% refund for an under 60min delay. We obviously disputed this as it’s was a lot more than 60mins only to be told we are wrong an it was less than 60mins. They think they can just rip people off an get away with it as they are a ‘big’ company, also absolute rip off prices to stand up most the time anyway! Take a look at Europe, cheaper, bigger and better trains. The ‘New’ trains are so small and uncomfortable id rather hitch on the back of a pigeon.

2019-12-09T23:39:01Z	19/11/19 18.26 train from Devonport to…	19/11/19 18.26 train from Devonport to Gunnislake . what a shambles and utter useless service a number of travellers received from GWR. Information point stated train delayed to 18:35 then 18:45 then cancelled so used the information help point and informed that we needed transport for 8 people 4 to Gunnislake and 4 to Bere Alston. after being put on hold and giving my number for call back (which never got)eventually told taxi would arrive.6.50 called again no taxi  assured it was on the way. 7pm another traveller called again told taxi on the way 7.20 taxi (people carrier)arrive but would only take the 4 for Gunnislake taxi driver contacted his controller and informed no only go to Gunnislake. again contacted information controller give all information again and told to contact GWR direct. another Traveller did this to be told they would check on it and held on hold for over 15 mins customer service response hopeless. it is now 8pm no taxi. 8.15 phoned taxi rank direct they had not received a request from GWR but kept on hold and would check  system while on hold a request came in. 8.30 still no taxi. I myself by now had made other arrangements and asked my daughter to come from Saltash to collect me as I could not stand in the cold any longer waiting and stayed the night at her house. I left my fellow travellers at 8.35pm still waiting for a taxi. I do not think that GWR customer service could get any worse but I was wrong they do not understand the meaning of customer service as all we got told was its being dealt with no times or explanations were given. if I could give a minus score I would.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2019-12-09T23:39:01Z	Absolutely shameful company	Customer service is not great any time I’ve had an issue and the train prices are extortionate. You would think that people should be encouraged to take public transport to save traffic congestion and be better for the environment but GWR and the others are incredibly greedy and evil that they keep driving up prices and not improving anything at all!Absolutely shameful company which need to re-evaluate their values and morals.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

All I get is just apologise and as example if one day I will not have enough time to get my ticket straight away I will get a penalty and then I will try to explain that didn't had enough time but no I still get a penalty .....Why my apologies they are not accept it on the case?? And the next thing I would like to mention is that almost all the staff at reading station they are really rude plus some of them at the gates really act like they own the station instead of helping with any information , or sometime the gates not open you almost have to get in your knee until one of them think to let you pass in which many times I lost my connection because of them.... That's really bad I think..... I did send so many letter's and never anyone has answered back that is a shame to .	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Delays. Overcrowding. Extortionate prices. Cancelled trains. Freezing trains. The list goes on. Its seems they are unable / uninterested in addressing the root causes of these issues. Perhaps they are more interested in sending a simple copy and past reply to customers in a vague attempt to manage their bad PR. The service they run is borderline criminal, and they continue to leech money out of customers who frankly are at the mercy to these  bandits. I feel sorry for the person who is scarcely paid the minimum wage to record these complaints, send them off to senior management before being instantly put into the bin.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-11-14T08:25:45Z	The stuff of evil	Terrible service, extortionate prices. Always eager to ruin your day. It’s never a pleasure with GWR (or any of these train companies). I previously called GWR when my brother’s phone died and he went to the wrong station (one of GWR’s stations) - he had little experience with trains but they wouldn’t do a thing to help him. They also charged for the call.Trains are consistently late.Prices are totally inconsistent with each other - it feels like a bad lottery - how much will they rob me for today?Trains are often crowded.GWR ignores any customer interaction that does not involve or lead to the customer paying GWR.Wrote this today because after paying through the nose for a return ticket I could barely afford, and getting through gates with no issue, the man checking tickets insisted I could not be on this train and I’d have to change to a later one (the only difference being that with this new route I got in 15mins later and had to do far more changes). And I also got charged £20 for it... if I did not pay they have systems in place to leech the money from me after - I only know because this was nearly the case as my card was declined.Totally evil. If you have a choice (Ride-sharing, coach, cycling, hitchhiking) other than the train, take it.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

I’ve been using the train between Bristol and Paddington and there’s absolutely no heating on despite it being the middle of November and despite me boarding around 4:30 in the afternoon. I’ve been sitting here shivering in my coat throughout the entire one and a half hour journey. The lack of heating feels very unfair given how expensive the ticket is, and given also that booking advance tickets with cheaper prices is not possible (I’ve tried several times). Why not just get the coach then?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-11-14T08:25:45Z	GWR Great Company 😀 But NO Hot Food😥	I view GWR as a great company with a strong brand image . Looking at there Winter timetable which starts on December 15th there appears to be a much improved service . Regarding the new trains the seating is ok I've sat on worse . My main issue is with the on board catering . I used to enjoy the option of buying a  bacon roll in addition to my free coffee and snack I receive in 1st Class. I pay around £120 for my two advanced 1st class singles for my 3 HR trip  .In relation total cost two advanced 1st class singles with Virgin trains cost  around £70 and you get a Full cooked English breakfast for a 1 hr 20 mins trip .It would be nice to offer something hot eg Pre order food for a long trip like Crosscountry railways do. I have now got to buy something before I board I want something mid trip.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	4
2019-11-14T08:25:45Z	Dangerously Overcrowded trains with GWR	Recently travelled with GWR, the return trip was London Paddington to Bristol.We had 5 tickets and seats, 3 adult and 2 children.In Paddington, the 2 boys managed to get onto the carriage we had reserved seat in, the adults were unable to get onto the carriage as there were so many people on it, the aisle was full, and the area around the doors was packed with about 12 people in front of us trying to get on, we spoke to a guard on the platform who explain that it was not his problem, either get on the train or stay on the platform as the train is leaving, we forced our way onto another carriage and was forced to stand for 90% of the journey, no hand rails, nothing to support yourself, only the other passengers squeezed in to stop you falling.Spoke to GWR who this response.Dear Customer,Thank you for your email regarding your return journey from London Paddington to Weston Super Mare. I’m sorry to hear you couldn’t sit in the seat you reserved for your trip and that the member of staff you asked for help didn't meet your expectations.We work hard to make sure all our customers get the seats they book, so it’s disappointing we didn’t manage that for you. I’ve looked into what happened and provided some information for you below.Unfortunately as you were able to find an alternative seat during your journey, we are unable to provide any compensation for the price of your tickets.Our system for seat reservations is normally very efficient, but sometimes things don’t always go to plan and our trains can get very crowded - which we can't always account for.With regard to the member of staff you spoke to on the station plaftorm, I've recorded your complaint and it will be passed on to the manager of that station so that they can investigate and speak to the member of staff concerned.Once we know exactly what happened and why, we’ll take any necessary steps to make sure it doesn’t happen again. This can range from giving the member of staff some extra training if they need it, to more serious consideration about whether or not they can do the job we want them to do.We keep details of any disciplinary action confidential, but I hope this reassures you that we’ll do everything we can to put this right for you.Once again, I’m sorry we didn’t manage to honour your booking and for your poor experience with our staff. I hope everything goes more smoothly next time you travel with us – and that you’ll have a more enjoyable journey.Yours sincerelyMarkCustomer Support Advisor	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-11-14T08:25:45Z	Appalling train service	Appalling service on the 14.15 service out of Paddington yesterday. Announced platform minutes before departure. Didn't advise that seat reservations were not in operation so hence everyone makes their way to their allocated seat to find its already been taken. It was supposed to be a 9 carriage train but was reduced to 5 carriages - so incredibly over crowded. Two of the remaining 5 carriages were first class (why is it that they manage to have enough carriages to cater for first class). So ended up with 3 carriages for standard class instead of the 7 expected. With most people booking in advance Great western railway know how many passengers they are expecting yet they can still reduce the service. The actions of the first great western staff caused extreme distress to some young travellers. Will not be travelling with Great Western Railway again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Yes occasionally they decide to strip a train if 4 carriages at rush hour and have people sat in the aisles but mostly it’s ok. Not great, but ok.I have the option of using chiltern into London from Bicester but I decided to use charlbury for easy access. Not any more!! I won’t use this railway again. I spend £200 a week for my ticket on this railway and I want my money back. Monday. 15.50 train home. Cancelled.Broken down train. Tuesday 15.50 train cancelled. Broken down train. Then to make matters worse, after getting the 16.22 that got held up for 30 odd minutes near oxford. Guess why?? Broken down train on line ahead. Wednesday. 15.50. Wow, it’s running. Great. No. Got stopped on the line for over 30 minutes behind freight train and then a slow moving train coming the other way. Now Thursday. 15.50 train. It’s boarding. Great!! No no no, we are all sat on it awaiting departure  and all the lights go off. Train broken down. Cancelled. I am not even joking. Now I’m sat on a overcrowded 16.22 on my way writing this because I’mFuming. I will not be using them again. They’ve lost between. £800 to £1000 a month from me. Incredible. I want a full refund for this weeks ticket.  I probably won’t get anything. (So a passenger sat next to me claims)) he’s tried many times. If you can find an alternate transport. Do it.

2019-10-25T23:54:16Z	Missing carriages / poor experience	I travelled from Portsmouth to Cardiff on GWR. We booked tickets well in advance and had reserved table seats in ‘coach A’. When the train arrived there was no ‘coach/carriage A’ it didn’t exist! And only coach D and E available. We asked a member of staff and showed them our ticket that said ‘coach A‘and they were confused as well! This made it difficult to find seats that would fit suitcases in a cramped train (your luggage area is appalling to begin with) let alone a ‘direct route’ everyone travelling to Cardiff was suddenly/ randomly told to get off that train at Salisbury onto another train 5mins before arriving there?? The staff were just as confused as the passengers, with staff frantically running across platforms to find the ‘next train’ for us. Personally not a great experience and of course all this fuss made us quite late arriving into Cardiff- poor experience.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2

2019-10-25T23:54:16Z	Chaos and the Staff ridicule you	"Quiet chaos, disoriented and unprofessional is how i would describe Penzance train station.Firstly it was unclear what platform our train was due from. The timetable had our train come in on platform 1, however a train on platform 2 was already waiting. It wasn't until the platform 2 train left and we had finally managed to locate a member of staff in a station with almost no staff to be seen, we found out that our train on platform 1 was in fact on platform 2 and had just left.Annoyed but willing to put half the blame on ourselves we proceeded to the ticket office where we were told they don't predict the platform until it arrives... which is not how it works anywhere else that we've been, and then she predicts to us that the next train we would need is platform 4...A train is already waiting but due to our disorientation from the last mixup we decided to ask some members of staff just to be safe.For starters, the staff members where difficult to make out as staff members and we could only see one persons lanyard and another's jumper, there was nothing else to indicate they where staff. The 3 stood huddled, chatting and messing about like school children and looked almost disgruntled that I dared excused them as a customer not wishing to get confused.They spoke bluntly and patronizingly that yes this is the train as I can see, and when I asked if the doors where closed because I should already be on it I was laughed at because ""you can't get on it now because the doors are closed"".Yes, i can see the doors are closed, that wasn't my question. My question was ""should I already be getting on?"".I felt laughed at and ridiculed by fully grown adults acting like ""back of the bus"" school kids.The pure level of unprofessionalism was enough to send our anxiety sky high and wouldn't expect to be spoken to like that by any ""adult"" let alone a group of adults in a professional position."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2019-10-25T23:54:16Z	New trains - really uncomfortable bumpy journeys	I commute Newbury / Paddington most week days. The line (especially Reading / Paddington) is terrible on these new trains - literally every second of the journey you are jolted about, either left/right or up/down, as if there is no suspension at all. It is worse on seats near the doors as you get nearer the wheels. I cannot imagine what this is doing for my back. There are also some really worrying bangs and bumps from under the train some days. By comparison I was on an intercity train in Spain a few weeks ago, the train was running at 155 mph and a really comfortable journey and not thrown about at all.  If Spain can do this, why cant we in the UK ?I suspect the entire line out of Paddington needs relaying but I doubt that will ever happen.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Funny enough, they don't let me pay (587 pounds per month). Obviously I can get tickets at the station but that way there is no way to load Nectar card points, which is really annoying as GWR advertises this on their website. I wasted an hour trying to pay on their website yesterday and all they could say when I finally managed to contact them was: ""there has been a known issue on payments on our website, go to the station"" (and forget your Nectar points worth ~20 pounds). This sort of problems has happened every single time I tried to use their app or their website.This would be fine... IF TICKETS WEREN'T SO EXPENSIVE! Nearly 600 pounds a month for an hour long train journey is insane... Especially when we should incentivise to get public transport!!!AND WHEN REPLYING TO THIS SAME REVIEW, THEY ADVISED ME TO CONTACT THEM VIA SOCIAL MEDIA, WHICH A) I DON'T USE FOR THESE PURPOSES AND B) SHOULD NOT BE THE CHANNEL TO SOLVE ISSUES.

Anyway to top this off today I actually managed to get time to buy a ticket from the machine in keynsham and it only printed one ticket supposedly an anytime return to and from bath... on my journey back after a long day at work the ticket didn’t work to then I realised I was only given one of the tickets for my journey (I thought it was an individual ticket for the journeys) I spoke to one of the very unhelpful and rude staff members at ‘GWR’ who simply wouldn’t let me through even though I clearly had an anytime return I even showed him the transaction on my bank account,  he reluctantly forced me to buy another ticket (I am an honest person) so I am now out of pocket? Absolutely disgusting. Your prices are also a disgrace, use public transport they say!!!!! Yeah cheaper to drive mate!!! I have lodged a complaint over £5 yes pathetic but it’s the principle not happy!!!! I should have told him I couldn’t afford it but dressed in a suit it may have been unbelievable haha!

2019-10-25T23:54:16Z	New trains unbearably uncomfotable	I travel several times a year from Paddington to Plymouth. I have a disability and really appreciated the soft comfy upholstered seats in First class in the old trains. The new trains are a disgrace. The seats in First class are very hard, not ergonomic and have rigid headrests at totally the wrong height. I now leave the train in pain that lasts until the next day. Added to this, the trains have no buffet car; insufficient room for luggage; harsh lighting; cheap and nasty design and after hearing about the toilets I have managed to avoid using them. The staff on board the trains (who I would give 5 stars to) acknowledge that the new trains are not fit for purpose. These trains area total downgrade in every respect.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2019-10-25T23:54:16Z	Hitachi a complete downgrade!	The HSTs are now regarded as a British design classic and, although they had been serving well for many years, I can understand why they needed to be upgraded.  The new Hitachi trains serving the 'intercity' route from Paddington are not inherently as poor as some people have made out - but the GWR version of them undoubtably is!The lighting is harsh, too bright and too white (compared to a Cross Country Voyager, which has a calming warm tone of light equivalent to that used in homes which is restful).  This feels like being in a hospital waiting room!  Add to that the drab green and grey interior colour scheme and you have an unfriendly, clinical environment.**Seating and comfort**I was prepared for bad seats after having read the reviews and advance press and yes, they're not great and feel like a cheap desk chair (there's a theme here!), but the biggest problem for me was the strange upright angle, and the noise and rattling (due to underfloor engines, especially the diesel ones).  It's a real downgrade from the beautifully cushioned, incredible suspension and smooth ride of a loco-hauled HST.  Why are we going backwards like this?**Toilets**I only took a short journey so didn't need to use it, but have heard feedback to say that they're actually quite good.**Cleanliness**How do you get a train, which is max. two years old, so filthy so quickly?  Maybe the staff have no pride in such a poorly designed train?  The floors were almost entirely stained, marks and spoils on walls, seats, everywhere.  Really looked disgusting and unhygienic.  Again, were the HSTs as badly maintained as this?**Service**Mine wasn't delayed but the new coach numbering system is a total mess.  What's with Zones?  Why make it so complicated?  Passenger information display at the station was confusing, took too long to digest and pointless.  Why not go back to simple Coaches A-Z system and state 'first class at rear/front'?  Again, it wasn't a broken system, so why break it?The in-train announcement speaker quality is excellent, maybe that's Hitachi's electronics background!I was on quite a late train so staff were chatting to each other, which is fine, but I got a general sense of apathy.  Nobody seemed to have much pride in their train or work.**Overall**Lack of buffet is a disgrace - it was always an integral part of a London-Devon journey and brought a sense of romance that has always been in such a scenic section of the railway.I've been travelling on the London-Devon route since BR days when I was a child, and this is definitely a downgrade.  Also, the half-assed electrification as far as Bristol Parkway is, frankly, an insult to this country.  We revolutionised the world with railways, and now we have this.  Oddly, LNER have done a much better job with these Hitachi trains, so it's not exactly Hitachi's fault!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2019-10-25T23:54:16Z	I can think of nothing positive about GWR...	GWR continue to be a joke. Every journey: I wish I had an alternative train provider. Advertise and sell tickets Paddington to Taplow (my local station). Do not actually provide...get off Slough, take bus to Taplow...not temporarily due to works but on a permanent semi-permanent basis. No note of this at their ticket machines. Message in Paddington: ‘Ask member of staff’. Ticket office closed, information counter closed, one grumpy member of staff he mutters ‘get bus’. I live in hope government will not grant franchise to GWR round. Unlikely of course, as they have continued to operate very poorly for many years already. GWR...ugh.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-09-28T08:59:41Z	Design award for the most inept catering layout I have ever seen!	Having paid for a 1at class ticket, I would expect a relatively peaceful journey for Paddington to Exeter.Sadly, whoever designed the brand new trains on this route decided it would be a good plan to situate the Pullman dining carriage one carriage away from the kitchen.That way the poor staff have to carry trays of hot food and pots of coffee along a swaying carriage full of passengers without dropping it all over the place. My journey has been similar to sitting by the kitchen door of a greasy spoon at breakfast time. And do you know what? After sitting there watching all the bacon going past: I was told I can't get a bacon roll only biscuits and cake!I award you the coveted accolade of Designer who never actually travelled on a train serving food trophy.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	3

2019-09-28T08:59:41Z	Zero star rating should apply	I’m not a big rail user but one of my buddies convinced me to give GWR a go, in retrospect I really wish he hadn’t...My other half and I recently booked a few days away in London, getting there via Tiverton Parkway to Paddington on the train, using GWR...The journey up to be fair pretty good, the return less so.....As we are not big train users we made sure we were at Paddington for our return in good time, we were plenty early in fact.  We printed our pre-purchased tickets on arrival from the automated machine and hung around a bit...  As we were way too early we headed to the Beer House bar to grab a coke, all was well, or so we thought...The TV monitor in the bar showed our train was delayed, not a whole lot but (as I recall) from 1603 to around 1610, then after a short while to around 1615....At around 1600 we left the bar to head to the platform, this to be in continued good time and on account the platform was just around 20yds away, at this rate we were 15mins early...Imagine our utter surprise when upon arriving at the platform just moments later the train was seen leaving.....We checked pretty much instantly with the platform guy and he advised us the train was the “1603” and it’d just left!Unsure what to do and querying the display boards that showed a delay we asked what we should do, the platform guy suggested we go to the information desk....We headed there to be told they get problems time to time with telemetry and it could be the boards were wrong! The guy at the desk then directed us to the ticketing office advising us we should be able to sort our tickets, Yeah right!When we got to the ticket desk we received no assistance and were told we’d have to buy secondary tickets at a cost of £148 (on top of the tickets already bought in good faith)... With little choice in this matter we did this, ‘guess we should count ourselves lucky as the next train was around 1630, just a short while later,With just a little time to spare we returned to the information desk for a second time to see what the route to refund would be.  We were told all’ be Ok we’d just need to email GWR with the details and they’d refund us....As if!!!I sent all details to GWR including photos of the original tickets, the replacements and full details of the event...They eventually replied to said they’d pass on notes ref the incorrect boards but wouldn’t refund the cost of our secondary tickets “as we were required to have them for our secondary journey”....Go figure???We were also told some utter cock and bull story along the lines that we should allow time to get to the platform and also allow time between platform transfers...Eh?????THEIR INFO BOARDS WERE WRONG!!!!They then had the indignity to add insult to injury and send secondary email asking for “how’d we do” feedback...RUBBISH!!!Let the train take the strain? I don’t think so...£148 on top of tickets already bought for the very same journey,Totally unethical and immoral treatment from GWR,It’ll be the car next time.Update....You’ll see below Brad’s written a helpful reply, thanks Brad, only one thing..... where’s my money????	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-09-28T08:59:41Z	0 would be the correct rating for my…Rubbish journey, non existent customer service and no thought to safety	0 would be the correct rating for my journey yesterday. My 19 year old son and his mate purchased return tickes for journey from llanelli to Bristol Temple Meads at a cost of £42.50 each to watch Swans play.Return train full of supporters stops at Port Talbot and is on stop for around 30 mins, at which point police officers enter the carriage and inform everyone that the train would be going no further and it would be returning to London. In fact there were no trains out of Port Talbot last night. There were no busses laid on.As their phones had died they couldn't ring home to ask to be picked up so had no alternative but to to take a taxi the 25 miles at a further cost of £45. They were stranded in the dark, what if they had no money on them? I dread to think. I rang company this am to be told they need receipt for taxi fare. How many 19 year olds are going to think of making a claim so getting a receipt from taxi driver? So an already expensive journey has turned out even more costly, in fact £130 and the match ticket was a meat £15 each.Awful or rather non existent customer service and total disregard to customer safety. Oh just incase you are unaware, if you find yourself in a similar situation the company will arrange and pay a taxi for you if you give them a ring and ask.

I tweeted earlier, and received the standard reply from 'Brad', about how they are ergonomically designed to give more support on longer journeys - repeated verbatim in some of the replies here. This is utterly patronising and dishonest. The seats could not possible have been ergonomically designed or I would not be in pain now. I had to bundle up my jacket to get a bit of support in my lower back. He seems to be suggesting that it is my body that is at fault. Nothing to do with the penny pinching attitude of the company, and the idiocy that has resulted in an almost vertical seat back.

2019-09-28T08:59:41Z	New trains but same woeful service...	They have always run a bad service but at least the old trains were comfortable. Now the services are composed of two separate trains joined together. It's hard to see which carriages have the available seats, so everyone now has to run along the platform with their heads ducked to look for the green lights above the seats (that's if the reservations haven't been switched off altogether in which case prepare for someone to ask you to move out of their seat). If you do actually get a seat you may soon regret that choice; basically they are non existent, just some fabric over hard plastic. After two hours you notice you're not alone in squirming in your seat (I take a cushion now). The vestibules are also quite restricted compared to the old ones so not even the luxury of sitting on the floor if busy. Don't worry though, an announcement might tell you of room in a carriage in the other train and all you need do is get off at the next stop and hope you make it before the automatic doors close (suffice to say, no one takes up on this offer).The buffet is gone and so now you might be lucky to see a trolley on your journey but they are sporadic and can't run if the service is busy. Toilets are reduced and there is no more space for luggage then on the old trains, so still the usual bags in the aisles. Still amazes me that they berate you for using their busy services which are the first cheap ones in the evening out of London whilst the ones just before run with ample room. The chaos of the 19:03 from Paddington to Plymouth is all of their own making.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

It was the best decision we’ve ever made.. On arriving at Bodmin Parkway we were impressed by the friendliness and caring attitude of the staff. They were so helpful and considerate from beginning to end of our journey. One of our group is a wheelchair user and they did everything possible to make her feel that her presence wasn’t an inconvenience to them. They went out of there way to make the day a happy one. She will be recommending GWR to all her Kidney  patients association. They all came across as a very happy bunch of staff who obviously love there job and GWR are lucky to have them.

Second time I've travelled on these new GWR trains and second time I've had a bad experience - the seats are rock hard and uncomfortable, power sockets poorly located, toilets cramped, and the ride is noisy and hard. My train was cancelled - the 18:17 from Chippenham to Paddington (because of insufficient staff to run the service...) so had to wait over half and hour for the next train to london, which when it arrived was so full there was nowhere to sit so had to sit in first class (had already paid an extortionate rate just to sit in standard class £63 day return on a Sunday) only to find the seats in FC are as poor quality as in standard class - there's virtually no difference. FC, which i'd sometimes use (and happily pay for) on the old 125 rolling stock was actually worth the money as it was very comfortable and with a trolley service - this new FC would be a total rip off if you were mad enough to pay for it. GWR spent years 'upgrading' the line and rolling stock, and the result of all those years of delays is dreadful trains, cancelled service and no where to sit. GWR your trains and service are a disgrace - avoid taking it at all costs if you are able.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-09-28T08:59:41Z	So here we go agai	This service is so bad. I have been unable to book a seat for both legs of a journey to Cornwall for about a year now - I am a regular passenger in this route - and since the new trains have been introduced it has got worse. There is insufficient space for luggage, the loos are constantly out of order (doors jamming, no water for hand washing). And the regular cubicles are so tiny that even when in service there is no room to move and when there is water for hand washing the design of the sink means it splashes all over the tiny cubicle floor. I’m about five foot tall so goodness only knows how anyone taller finds this part of the ‘customer experience’.  These are inherent and consistent problems and not just a one off. Today only five carriages between Penzance and Plymouth so standing room only at Liskeard. And all of this for just short of £300 pounds if travelling first class. A further five carriages joined at Plymouth (disembark and run for a seat people) but only one loo working on the train after Plymouth and no disabled loo despite a ‘disabled facilities’ coach.  Seats hard and uncomfortable with no head rest cushions on many. And no buffet car and passengers from standard without easy access to refreshments. (Btw - during the consultation no one was asked if they would prefer at the seat service if the trolley was unreliable and no other options were available). I observed a number of people including the elderly and infirm  knocking on the staff door to ask when the trolley would be coming through. Automated announcements with no regular updates about whether the train was running on time (important when planning to link to a branch line). General consensus from passengers was ‘how can they get this so wrong’.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

I amsomewhat disbaled - walk with two elbow crutches - and thanks to the ""Assistance"" we received, we had help getting to our seats from Paddington - a wheelchair awaited me as we arrived at Swindon and I was taken speedily to the platform for Gloucester and we were seated in the ""wheelchair"" appropriate carriage. We were also met at Gloucester. The journey was thus a delight; simple and extremely courteously sorted. Before we left Gloucester station I explained to the person at the gate that I would need assistance on the 10th ... the woman wasn't very helpful, told me that nothing could be done in site and gave me a card and a number to call.We were going on the river Severn and didn't have a mobile - poor connections anyway - but I did phone thenumber at about 7.30am this morning, only to be told that they couldn't help ""on the day""Well, we arrived at the station about 3 hours before our train was due and I spoke to the gentleman at the ticket counter. He not only sorted assistance but he was also able to get us on an earlier train. We still had to change at |Swindon but we had assistance getting on the train at Gloucester and a young manwas waiting as we alighted at Swindon and he actually waited with us and got us on the train and found us two seats with extra leg room. When we arrived at |Paddinton we were ""on our own"" BUT we were extremely pleased with the courtesy, assistance and help we received on both journeys - all the male BR personnel who we met were extremely helpful and we'd give them 100% PLUS!!!

2019-08-21T17:39:18Z	The mystery of the vanishing carriage	Travelled to Cornwall today, caught a train from Bristol. I had booked in advance and reserved a seat, which my ticket said was in coach D. Train pulls into the station - couldn't see coach D. Asked the guard on the platform, he said there was no coach D! Myself and a lot of other customers asked what we were supposed to do, the guard said the reservations were not working. So, got on the train - every seat in the carriage was reserved and occupied! Eventually got a seat at the next stop when some passengers left the train. Then, to finish everything off, it was announced the refreshment trolley could not make its way through the train as it was so crowded (here's a tip GWR, try not cutting an entire carriage), and that the static trolley could be found between coach D (which, remember, doesn't exist) and coach E!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-08-21T17:39:18Z	Reviewed trip to Cornwall	I was due to travel back to London from Bodmin  on the 12th July at 11:16 however when we arrived early at the train station we could see there were no seat reservations but no communication as to why. I found a member of staff with difficulty as it’s not well staffed who informed me that the train service  had been reduced from a 10-5 carriages but may be ok as the last service was busy.I  am attempted to board the service but was unable to due to capacity. The train was already standing room only and plus plus luggage in the corridors. The train manager met me at the door and said I could try and squeeze on but recommended waiting for the next train. They also said there was no catering on the whole journey. I can’t stand nor should I stand for a journey in which I have paid for a seat on. It would have made me unwell. I had to wait at Bodmin station as my parents had left thinking I was boarding the train until 12:10. I attempted to get a cup of tea from the cafe however this was also shut. I managed to board the 12:10 train and managed to get a seat. The catering service was very poor due to the changes the company has made to the trains. The trolley didn’t get to us until Reading! I still ordered a tea as did many others as we were thirsty. This wasn’t a once off. Needless to say on my journey down to Cornwall on the 8th the train was extremely busy with people standing and too much luggage so the trolley service couldn’t even get down the carriages. I don’t know who thought taking the catering carriage and luggage systems out just to fit more customers in was a good idea on a holiday destination and commuter train service. I completed a train delay repay form which was declined as there was no delay with my train and given what can only be seen as an automated response because her computer said no and didn’t read the comments. I subsequently completed the appeal form thinking a human may read it and getting really annoyed at the process at this point to find it had been rejected again for the same reason.I have been travelling with GWR for years as I am from Cornwall but work in the NHS in London after university. There’s always been problems not this illogical. It’s always a busy service no matter what time of day or year and always issues with over crowding and lack of storage space but it’s even worse and more inadequate now more than ever and then the cost has increased. I paid over £115 for a return. You can fly abroad in less time and better service for less. I don’t get a lot of time off so need to saviour it and it puts me off going home knowing I’m going to have a nightmare journey at least one way. The service needs to get better and focus on customer experience not increasing more seats and revenue.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-08-21T17:39:18Z	BRING BACK BRITISH RAIL!!!	These new trains are the worst I've ever travelled on in 40 years! Rock hard seating, NO buffet car or trolley service from london to Plymouth, very poor luggage space, deafening engine noise which vibrates through the floor into the seats and vibrates your conkers off!!!some cretin decided it was a good idea instead of having an engine at each end with near silent cabins to putting the engines underneath!!! I cannot travel on these ghastly trains and now having to fly to London which is incidentally cheaper by £30!!! First class are rock hard too for double the price, gwr bring back our very comfortable HST trains!! It's obvious that privatisation is built for profit in mind with nasty cheaply finished, uncomfortable trains and not a single thought for the poor unfortunate travelling public who pay extortionate ticket prices for this abysmal service, avoid GWR AT ALL COSTS!!!.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2019-08-21T17:39:18Z	Long delays, packed trains, safety and failure of seat reservations.	I've just written a review concerning my Paddington to Saltash journey last Thursday (11th July at 19:03 ).This was 1hour 5 minutes late reaching Plymouth - too late for passengers to catch scheduled services into Cornwall so all were taxied by GWR to their destinations - adding to their delays - total 1 hour 25 minutes in my case. Curiously - and very worryingly - for a service company, GWR deny that there was any delay at all !However, in addition to this problem, due to the train's late arrival in Paddington, no reservation tickets were put on the seats,  such that the sprightly first boarders clustered round the information board at Paddington just grabbed any seat they could. Being 80 years of age I wasn't quick enough but in any case couldn't have reached my reserved seat since the train was packed to a point which should, by any yardstick, be considered unsafe. People were even sitting in the toilets - which rendered them unuseable for the purpose they were intended. I thought I might have been able to sit down after Reading but no such luck until later in the journey. There was, of course, no buffet bar since the late departure from Paddington  made this impossible.  The train manager was as helpful as he could be. He even went the length of the train taking a note of who was travelling onward into Cornwall. This was however of no avail. All onward passengers had to queue at the Waiting Room on Platform 4 , Plymouth Station, from where all were eventually allocated a taxi to their booked station .	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

I had just completed the 100km Race to Stones and I was a broken lady....but the staff at Swindon station and on the train could not have been better.  The lady in the ticket office filled my water bottle for me, the platform guard said he would call me for my train (I had a 55 min wait) if I fell asleep.  Then a lovely onboard GWR employee a gentleman called Shanon (who got on at Swindon to start work - the 8:35pm to Paddington) carried my bags on for me, let me sit in the First Class carriage that was the carriage the pulled up closest to me as I could barely walk.  He got me a cup of tea and some biscuits and then phoned ahead to Reading to check if I could have some help with my transfer to the Guildford service.  The onboard guard (sorry I did not get his name) checked the times and platform for me, which mean I made my connection easily.  All round FANTASTIC service + the GWR train was clean and on time.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	5

2019-07-08T17:33:21Z	Cancelled train chaos	We booked a return ticket for a visit to London for a special birthday celebration. The inbound  trip was fast and efficient and we had a great day/evening in London.  We arrived back at Paddington the next day in good time in preparation for our return journey.  We were monitoring the display boards for the journey and noticed that it was saying 'cancelled' for this trip.  We then went to the information desk to enquire about options. The options offered were not viable as there was a significant change in timings and we had commitments at home. We were forced to board a train terminating before our destination and make our own arrangements from there.  This negative experience and inconvenience spoilt my birthday treat and it appears that it is entirely due to GWR's 6 day working contracts, which result in a lack of cover for Sunday services.  There were in fact two trains cancelled on the S Westerly route on that Sunday. This is not acceptable to customers and needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency!! Customers are NOT impressed!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

They have not given me a reason for this, just a status of 'rejected', multiple times. I've sent multiple emails with no reply, and have even contacted a member of their Facebook support team (who was very polite, but not able to help me at all).It's been weeks now, and it's clear that their policy is just to ignore me and hope I give up. This is atrocious customer service, on top of a very delayed and uncomfortable journey. If you have the option to travel with another company, or even take the coach, I recommend you do so.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-07-08T17:33:21Z	Incapable of organising a booze up in a brewery	Whenever there is an incident on the train line, GWR show themselves to have nobody in their organisation capable of minimising the disruption or organising alternative travel. There was an incident tonight near Langley station, if there was anybody in the organisation with an above room temperature IQ they might have considered it sensible to turn the trains around at Reading for those west of the incident & Hayes for those east of it. Instead we get the usual confusion & paralysis from the staff, who seem to think that no trains should run anywhere on the railway because of an incident on a small section of the railway. Of course there are no replacement bus services. A dreadful company with truly clueless staff.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Hi there, I just wanted to say a big thank you to the members of staff who were on the 21:18 service from St Austell to Plymouth. I suppose it’s not often that you get good feedback but I really want to say how helpful they were. I was travelling home from work and have had a very stressful day already, and had in my tiredness missed the stop at Liskeard and before I noticed the train was pulling away off to Plymouth. I honestly was going through a myriad of emotions and was pretty stressed and upset and went looking for someone on the train to see what my options were and to potentially buy another ticket back to Liskeard. Your staff members were very sympathetic and could see I was rather upset and stressed out and they very kindly allowed me a free ticket to travel back to Liskeard on the next service. Not only that but the kind lady gave me a complimentary drink voucher as well which was so unexpected and really made my day! Had I not received such great customer service I would have probably got more upset about the situation and worked up but they really calmed me down and assured me that it would all be ok. Thank you so much for the great service and I will be sure to always try and travel on your GWR services when I can! Thanks again! If I post a photo of the note perhaps you could locate the staff member and thank her for me personally again as she really represented your organisation in a really great way, and outdid herself in the situation!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	5

2019-06-25T11:04:56Z	The Night Riviera - A night to remember.	I tried The Night Riviera for the first time (at Penzance) with high hopes and great expectations, having tried the Caledonian Sleeper previously.Safe to say, it was, as the title of the review states, a night to remember. The member of staff at the Penzance lounge was friendly and welcoming and the lounge itself was comfortable and stocked up with plenty snacks and drinks. Boarding was simple enough and a member of staff showed me to my room and took my order for breakfast. The lounge car was a nice place to be too and the staff member at the bar was very friendly. As for the cabin itself, it may be small but its very nice and I did manage a good few hours of sleep.Having dozed off somewhere around Truro, I woke up in Reading feeling well-rested. Breakfast was presented to me at the time I requested. The train arrived into London Paddington on time. As per the rules for guests travelling Penzance to London, passengers can stay on the train until 6:45am even though the train arrives into London at 5am. I stuck around until 6am and used the first class lounge. Again, friendly staff and well stocked up with snacks and drinks.All in all, I'd happily vouch for the Night Riviera as one of those things you have to do in your lifetime at least once. I couldn't recommend it enough.Many thanks GWR! :)	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	5
2019-06-25T11:04:56Z	Power sockets on the hitachi trains	I travel on GWR from Taunton to Paddington regularly, and wanted to comment on the new Hitachi trains. The power sockets have been placed in a position where it is near impossible to see them, to plug in a device. In the old trains the power point was in front of you so you could see where to plug in.It takes guess-work alone to get something into the socket - unless you have bendy eyes like a snail they cannot be seen.  Someone should have tried these out before installing seats with such inconvenient power sockets.I find the new trains more comfortable than the old ones overall.Another observation is that in the micro-toilets, the water squirter over the sink spills into the floor.Please move the power sockets - many thanks, Bill.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	4

2019-06-25T11:04:56Z	GWR Smartcards be aware	I went to slough station this evening to renew my season ticket. My agent Amir told me that company policy said that I needed to upgrade to smartcard as paper tickets were being discontinued.I asked how long it would take and he said two minutes, he asked my for date of birth and email address. They already have my name and my address from the photocard. With this information they get the complete picture and perfect opportunity for identity theft.The printer was not working and after 15 minutes `Amir informs me that is going to take longer. At this stage I asked him to delete my records and give me a paper ticket. He says I need to contact customer services and see what they can do for me.I request to speak to Siva the station manager, he is out having a smoke. Amir goes out to speak to him and after 5 minutes he informs me that he will be coming. I wait additional 5 minutes and Siva is nowhere to be found. This is a shocking service, stealing 30 mins of my time on something that only benefits GWR. Not an apology just the machine is not working and reluctantly giving me my paper ticket which is all I wanted.The personal data that they have on you is totally unnecessary and an abuse of trust. How do they protect your data, why the DOB, be aware.....	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-06-25T11:04:56Z	Just avoid.	"Just avoid.Yes the hanging bike racks DO have the potential to break bike spokes.What the poster is talking about is the new system of carrying bikes.On Express services.There are about 3 or 4 little wardrobe sized cupboards where its compulsory to strip your bike of all heavy luggage and insert itvertically onto the 'hook'.This places c.100kg weight of moving pressure on the spoke which is bearing the load.This will not just break the spoke but buckle the wheel.(Repair Bill about 60 or 70 pounds with a 4 week wait)Unless you stand holding it steady in person all the way.(Not possible as the guard orders you to leave it and sit)There were no retaining straps or devices fitted.A stupid fold down luggae rack completed the picture but this could not be used if a bike was being stored there.It was either or.Your supposed to pre reserve a place too.Theres room for about 6 bikes on every train.Thats all.Its virtually impossible to take a bike now between London and say Bristol on a High Speed Service.Awnser?Either dont use the serviceor use the service but ""pay later""-after a proper service has been recieved and if not-dont pay!:)The overcrowding will help with this as the aisles make it impossible to walk along the train .Personally I will not lift a little finger to stop or report any passenger who avoids the fare on this dreadful service.Not will I attend court of volunteer as a witness or come to the aid of any member of staff.Just to let you know!Thanks Ahead"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2019-06-25T11:04:56Z	On Saturday 8th we travelled to Cardiff…	On Saturday 8th we travelled to Cardiff on the 8.32 train for an England  World Cup cricket Match.There we’re only 3 carriages on this train and to say it was overcrowded is an understatement.A woman I was sitting next to told me that we should have booked seats in advance so that GWR would be able to calculate how many carriages were needed.Really?Does nobody in this company monitor events like this or even read a newspaper.On the outward journey some people couldn’t get on the train. The return journey was even worse. There was meant to be a service at 7.30 pm to Bristol Temple Meads but hey ho this had been cancelled, with no other information given.Reluctantly we joined another 3 carriage train to Taunton which was absolutely packed,crushed standing room only so we stood all the way.Not sure the air con was working properly and one young boy felt faint but as we arrived at Temple Meads  message was given Could passengers look and see if anyone was struggling with the conditions and offer them a seat.This as we got off after standing for 45 minutes +.The final blow was finding out that the 7.30 train from Cardiff which we could have got all the way to Bath was not in fact cancelled but instead started at Newport,one stop down the line.Why were people not told this.Honestly this is no way to run a service,you should be ashamed of the way the public are treated.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2
2019-06-25T11:04:56Z	First Class experience poor Part 2	I left a review earlier about the poor state of First Class on GWR, only to be hit with more misery on another trip. My earlier review talked about GWR not delivering a premium service for the hugely high (frankly ridiculous) prices they charge for First Class. Unfortunately, those problems also extend to the staff, who seem woefully ill trained to deliver the premium service their customers are paying for. An example is my last trip. On a long route between Penzance and London I asked for a second sandwich late in the trip. I was rudely told that I had already had a sandwich earlier and would have to pay for a second one, despite having a full fare First Class ticket! I have no idea is that's correct company practice. But what I do know is that (1) I have had to spend over £5k commuting from London down to Cornwall in First Class over the past three months for a work project and this has NEVER happened before on any of those trips (ie you have always been able to have more than one sandwich) and (2) if it is the company's rule then they should be ashamed of themselves (considering the cost of the First Class tickets and the measly nature of the sandwiches on offer). Anyway, to make the matter worse the rude woman serving me first slammed down a sandwich on my table and then 'confronted' me for allegedly taking a picture of her! The fact was that I had not done anything of the sort. I was simply reading the news on my phone! But she was clearly paranoid that I was perhaps going to complain about her attitude and had taken a photo to identify her. That fear had also changed her mind about giving me another sandwich! What a joke! But all this stuff is just symptomatic of what's going wrong with the service in the so-called GWR First Class.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

I appreciate that GWR can never know the extent of passengers during events but it's seems as if no prior planning took place to combat thid. Having to wait for the next train or even the one after that for our scheduled journey due to over crowding. Train staff are unsympathetic and for the most part less than willing to help with questions or queries. Now all this would be fine if pricing were to compete with other modes of transport but with recent price increases there is no reason to use GWR if you need to get anywhere on time or even at all unless it's a last resort	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2

2019-06-03T12:36:45Z	problems of overcrowding	The new trains run smoothly and are clean and comfortable to sit in.The staff are very helpful,kind and friendly. However it does seem  that certain factors haven’t been fully addressed. I travel fairly regularly on the Penzance/Paddington line. I realise some days and certain times are likely to be very busy. This was the case with the older trains and the same now despite the extra carriage. People frequently have to travel standing in very cramped spaces. Provision for luggage on a ‘long haul’ train journey are woefully inadequate . It is all very well to ask that luggage is not allowed to block the aisles- impossible to avoid. And WHY no buffet car in these trains. Because of the overcrowding the trolley is frequently unable to get down the train. Queues of frustrated thirsty passengers cause further congestion and irritation. It would be good to have advance warning as most people only discover this lack of a facility once on the train.Is all this the result of a company wishing to make as much money as possible while not ensuring passenger comfort and satisfaction?And yes - I did have a seat, which I booked and reserved in advance,and travelled  in relative comfort though I was very thirsty by time of arrival.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	3

2019-06-03T12:36:45Z	Appalling service for disabled and elderly passengers	I cannot believe my ongoing experience with trying to obtain a scooter permit for my disabled mum.  She had one issued a couple of years ago and still has the same scooter.  I completed the application form and enclosed a photo but it was rejected as they needed further information about the specificiations. Their letter contained no email or phone no and returned the whole application rather than keeping at their end.After contacting them, I was told they needed a copy of the user manual (this happened the first time and I found it in seconds online!) - apparently they don't keep records for more than 12 months and it seems to be beyond their skill set, to look online for user manuals or keep a log of which scooters are suitable, or have previously been issued. Bearing in mind, most people using assisted travel are elderly and disabled and probably don't have access to the internet or can use a computer.I then returned the application again with a copy of the user manual (26 pages) printed out on 3rd May to the freepost address.  Since then, I have been trying to find out if it has been received and that they now have everything needed to issue the permit but all I get told, despite raising an official complaint is that it takes 28 days to process!!!  My parents travel in less than 3 weeks and are now very stressed out as I am!!!

I have to travel from Truro to Paddington weekly with GWR and the new trains have made a terrible (but in some ways familiar and quaint) service into a miserable, soulless, robotic experience. How could they buys such awful trains? I love trains and this mode of travel but GWR is a disgrace.  No quiet carriage in reality, so passengers who book it on purpose for no phone pinging and loud calls are left to tell others who don't know or care that it's the quiet carriage (and risk getting told to eff off because the train manager is ALWAYS to nervous to tell anyone) because the signage is a measly tiny poster on the wall at the back.

First up - all credit to GWR staff who for years have always been unfailingly polite and helpful.Most recent trip report. Travelled from Bath to Paddington.....first time on the newish trains. Legroom in standard class was good. Seats dreadful ....like sitting on stone - who the hell in GWR approved the supply of such terrible seats? The so-called quiet carriage is very inconspicuous with signs placed high and hard to read - so peace and quiet on the trains is now a thing of the past. Returned later in the day in First Clas - what a waste of money. Gone are the nice comfy seats, replaced with hard ones with equally hard backs. Even worse in the appalling lack of legroom. Again, which GWR management approved such seats and legroom? Truly dreadful. We will travel in standard class in future. As for the GWR website - useless and put to shame by the one at Trainline which we always use even though it costs more.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2
2019-05-12T18:22:25Z	APPRECIATION FOR GWR EMPLOYEES GOING THE EXTRA MILE...	We travelled to Cardiff on 17th April and returned to Oxford on the 19th. Our return journey, which was very stressful because our son fell ill was alleviated  because your staff throughout our journey from Cardiff were very supportive and caring.  Your bus replacement drivers were very sympathetic and helpful by calling a first aider and allowing us to wait on the bus. The first aider, Mr Kieran Tatterton at Bristol Parkway was extremely helpful. Seeing how weak our son was, he went out of his way to make him comfortable, gave him water etc. He's an indispensable GWR employee who deserves a promotion and pay rise. Overall, it was a great positive experience and a display of human kindness. We recommend GWR wholeheartedly!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	5

Someone was sitting in my reserved seat, and when I asked her to move she pointed out (quite rightly) that there was nothing in overhead panel to indicate seat was reserved.

2019-04-21T18:41:22Z	What sort of people are making decisions for GWR?	Traveled from Bodmin Parkway to Paddington today. The new trains are awful. The seats are so uncomfortable, there are no litter bins for you to clear rubbish, and the catering service is dire. It is ridiculous for GWR to have got rid of the buffet car!!! The trolley service is unable to cope. It did not arrive at my seat until I had been on the train for 3 hours, and it had run out of hot water!!!! Hence I was not able to have a hot drink during my 4 hour journey. It is an appalling service that GWR is providing. One staff member said that the buffet car had been replaced by the trolley service following a passenger survey which revealed people would prefer to be served at their seats. It is like Brexit - people are voting for things without thinking through the practical implications, and then bosses simply try to meet their requests even though it is OBVIOUS that it is impractical to do so. How does GWR imagine they can run a trolley service when the Penzance trains are often packed and people and luggage are occupying the aisles!!! What a waste of [our] money for the new trains that I understand are now going to have to be altered.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-04-21T18:41:22Z	Apologies do not change Facts or the design of a train.	"WoW! What a difference a train makes!Outward journey Penzance - Reading on Saturday. So called ""old train"". A fantastic experience, as usual. Great communication at every station to welcome customers aboard and information on the train and Buffet car. Delicious hot breakfast and lunch from selection of food and drinks.) Comfy seats and clean toilets.Great Service. Return journey Reading - Penzance on Monday. What can I say......!!!!There was no communication at all that I was aware of. Nothing to outline the overhead ""traffic light"" system of seat reservations so passengers, without a reservation, were continually being asked to move, having sat in a ""green light"" / non-booked seat on boarding that had turned into ""a red light""/booked seat somewhere down the line.Since there was no communication, it was assumed there was a buffet car by others and myself. A long walk up the train with a fellow passenger involved navigating suitcases everywhere because there was nowhere to stow them. The search for the elusive Buffet car ended in the First Class section with a closed door.A Passenger in First Class informed me that ""this was 'a new train' as opposed to 'an old train' therefore had a trolley service, etc, etc, etc."" I asked ""How are you meant to know?"" ...........!As it turned out, the trolley service simply cannot and could not navigate all the suitcases (see above) blocking the carriages.  And, as it turned out, on a second journey up the train, this time in search of a trolley service that obviously couldn't get anywhere, I discovered from the First Class passenger (see above) that her name was Jane Jones, GWR Head of Public Affairs,on presentation of her business card.I appreciate that Ms. Jones did accompany me back to Coach A from First Class to try and address the issues with us and try and defend GWR by way of an apology. But sadly apologies do not change facts or the design of the train.It is interesting to note from an article from “Cornwall Live” that:""Passengers can expect more seats, more frequent services, better on-board facilities and shorter journey times, saving as much as 14 minutes between Paddington and Penzance.(*Better on-board facilities"". Experience appears to say something very different.)The luggage racks are very different from the existing HST trains. They are narrower, but with more space above. Hitachi insists that they can take full-size luggage.*(*It depends on how you define ""full-size luggage"". My small rucksack just fitted in the luggage rack)There is no buffet car, instead trolleys will deliver food and drink to passengers.(*An impossible task)The Pullman service will continue, with meals served in first class.(*Yep)Toilets are spacious, with baby changing facilities.""Yes, they are spacious....huge, in fact. But at what cost? Luggage Storage Space. (See above).I also witnessed two young girls get locked into the toilet; with one becoming hysterical. The train driver came and rescued them; One older person who hadn't got a clue which buttons/ lever to press to close and lock the door; and one young man who didn't or couldn't lock the door and so the door swung open at a rather inopportune moment. Finally, everyone wearing the green uniform of GWR seem to me to be great ambassadors for the company in terms of doing their very best and a great job, against all the odds. It is certainly not their fault and yet, they seem to be the ones getting all the flack from customers who deserve a lot better from GWR. We all do."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2019-04-21T18:41:22Z	Awful New Trains	I travelled first class between Penzance and Exeter today for the first time on the GWR new green 800 trains. I was looking forward to something really special considering the age of the HSTs but I've never been so dissipointed with a train in 45 years of train travel. Gone are the luxurious and comfortable leather seats to be replaced by cloth seats that are rook hard uncomfortable. I actually got back pain sitting in these seats after only 30 minutes and was really stiff and achy when I finally got off at Exeter after 3 hours. Thank god I wasn't travling to Paddington. These seats are quite frankly awful, the worst in the rail industry in my opinion and I'm a seasoned rail commuter. These trains are noisy, they vibrate and sway during the journey and the suspension is really rough. Theres no buffet car anymore and no hot food. In first class there's just a trolly serving drinks, biscuits and cake. The paid trolley has more but it is nothing like the buffet car they replace. First class used to be lovely on this service but now it really isn't worth the extra cost. There are charging sockets at each seat which is useful but they are difficult to use by the seat. The tables are wider and they is a little more room but it makes no difference when the rest of the seat is so uncomfortable. The HSTs were old but so much better than these new trains. What were GWR thinking when they developed these trains. Certainly not customer comfort that's for sure. I'm honestly not making this up. These trains are just aweful. They have turned one of the best journeys I made on the rail network from the best to the worst. A lot of people were making the same comments on my journey. I want to see these services improve tourism in Cornwall but sadly I'm afraid they will have the adverse affect. My comments are in no way directed towards the GWR staff on these services who are exemplary in every respect and could not be more helpful.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2019-04-21T18:41:22Z	Rubbish	We recently returned from a long journey home from Australia so paid to travel first class from London to Exeter with GWR thinking it would be more pleasant. However a couple boarded at Westbury, when asked for their tickets they said they had standard tickets and had boarded first class by mistake. The conductor asked them to leave at the next station. They did not move, even though the ticket conductor was standing right next to their seat he did not 'remind' them to move and left them to travel all the way to Exeter! To top this they were loud and disruptive. Not what we wanted when trying to relax.When I complained we were told that it is not the conductors job to remove them or fine them. They said it could be more disruptive if they were told to move again so are allowed to remain!!What about fare evasion, fines for having the wrong ticket? They clearly done this on purpose and had no intention of moving. Why should we pay extra in future for first class tickets when we are now aware that we cannot be made to move.No wonder fare prices continue to increase. What is the point of a ticket inspector. We may as well all travel with the cheapest ticket and sit where we like!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2019-04-21T18:41:22Z	Sadly, the most untrustworthy train operator	I have had the misfortune of trying to resolve complaints with GWR on at least two occasions in the last year (having made a grand total of 4 journeys to Penzance from London and back). The first took a year and 3 months to resolve and an email to the CEO. In summary, this complaint was that they had charged me twice for the same seat. The second is ongoing but customers should know that:a) if you sit in first class (like I did for my wife's birthday) you aren't guaranteed any food or drink whatsoever. The bits they put up on the website mislead you into believing that it is part of the service. It is not, according to GWR themselves. This does of course beg the question as to why food and drink is advertised at all. b) Do not accept promises for recovering any costs you may have incurred by train staff as the customer service centre will not honour any such promises.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2019-04-21T18:41:22Z	What happened to GWR?	What happened to GWR? They used to have comfy seats and good ticketing for reservations. On the newer trains a trip back to London consists of complete carnage. Their failure to put up the appropriate/any reservation signage leads to people taking other reserved seats once theirs is taken, and a game of musical chairs arises at every stop. My last few trips have honestly just been such a terrible experience, it feels disappointing that my trips have to start and end with GWR as the stress associated with their transport is too frequent. This really needs to be addressed as you can tell by the atmosphere on the train, no one is happy to be here.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2

2019-04-21T18:41:22Z	Clinical Western Railway Not Great	I think it's time to take the Great out of GWR because they've completely lost the plot. They've should've designed a new HST 125 instead of the new robotic clinical Hitachi rubbish. Looks good from outside, but inside it looks clinical. No quiet carriage, stiff seats that are extremely uncomfortable, giving a lot of people backache and stiff necks. You need to make sure you take pain killers with you if you're going on a long journey on on of these trains. They have vibration too and that never stops. They must take Great out of the name, because Great they're not. WR is fine, actually.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

I sat down and my feet did not touch the floor! the pain in my legs and buttocks were unbearable. I figetted to get comfortable.  The pain was too much to bear. I stood for the journey as sitting was not an option. I was shocked that this train was travelling from London to Penzance!  Poor travellers travelling this far, I was only travelling 35miles and that was too far'!!  I will never use GWR services again. I will opt for a comfortable journey and travel according to which company is providing my travel! If a man designed these seats he should be sacked for his lack of customer service to women and not for just long legged men!!!  I will not use your trains ever again.

Immediately I contacted GWR by messenger and by email. Then I received an answer with a link to fill a form for the delay. I couldn't fill it because this form requires the number of the ticket, which I have never received. I sent an email with attached files with proof of double payment but I don't think somebody would bother for this because of their words ""we can’t do it for you here – I’m sorry about that."" I'm lucky that the amount is not too big, only 16.80 but I'm disappointed about the way how GWR(big and respected company) treats their customers."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-03-14T07:46:52Z	GWR continues to disappoint	You would have thought the new trains would be an improvement but it seems it's given GWR an excuse to reduce the on-board service even further. There's no buffet car anymore so you have to wait for the single trolley service to come through your carriage. When it does finally arrive after an hour the choices are pitiful. There's no hot food any more, it's just tea or plain coffee. The soft drinks aren't even chilled. Nothing worse than a warm coke! Prices go up, service cones down.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2019-03-14T07:46:52Z	No complaints here	I have read all the reviews about GWR. One of the reasons I read them all was because on the 25th of February I was sat at Reading station waiting for my train, which was 4 minutes late. Nothing when you look at the bigger picture of running a large Railway network. These two women were moaning about the fact that the train was 4 minutes late and that they were regular users. I asked them 'If you feel this way, why do you continue to use them?' No answer. I use GWR on a regular basis and have only had the odd delay of a few minutes and I live out in the country. For those who miss connecting trains because of a train that is a few minutes late, that is bad time management. You wouldn't leave a few minutes difference if you were catching an internal flight within Europe, give yourself plenty of time for your journey. For those of you who are fortunate to travel in First class, you as a first class passenger should get extra benefits and to be charged for a sandwich sounds a bit dodgy to me. If this is the case then GWR really needs to step up to the plate and sort it out. As for crowded trains, again I have been on busy trains but we have always managed to get a seat, together. One thing I must say to all your travellers, put your bags on the above shelving, not on the seat next to you. It is selfish, wrong and just lazy causing another traveller to have to ask you to move it. That particular passenger maybe shy or not too confident so please do not take up a seat with bags, paperwork or whatever you might have and whilst we are on the subject of selfish travellers and you are out there. A quiet carriage means exactly that, quiet, no phones, no loud conversations, no noisy laptops pinging and making computer noises, just good old peace and quiet. If it is the only carriage available, respect the rules...I do!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	5
2019-03-14T07:46:52Z	'attitude' problem of GWR customer service staff	Why is it GWR can get away with not only providing poor train service but also extremely poor customer service. Any problem or complaint is met by condescending, patronising or indifferent responses from staff generally. All trained, it seems, in the art of delivering a range of 'stock' answers to any questions or difficulties experienced by customers. The rigidity and unfairness of GWR rules is bad enough but the abrupt attitude and, quite frankly, rudeness many GWR staff offer up beggers belief.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2019-03-14T07:46:52Z	Comedy club	I hope one day i’ll be laughing about the delays, the cancelled services, those times I have been stranded in some unknown stations between London and Reading without a bit of information on when I’ll be able to leave again. But today is not that day. This company, seen the public duty of their private and extremely well paid service, should be subject to a parliamentary inquiry. Every three months we get a ticket price increase without seeing the benefits. Getting a refund is a mission impossible aimed to put off anyone that fairly wanted to do so. Going public would not be the solution as quality would go even worse, but a healthy review of responsibility is necessary.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2019-03-14T07:46:52Z	Another awful travel experience with…	Another awful travel experience with GWR yesterday evening on the train from Bristol Parkway to London. The GWR app had ‘technical issues - why do I still bother when Trainline is so good?! The train was of course late but only about 15 minutes...A new train but no buffet car and no trolley service.  Inexcusable- and no apologies. The seats are butt-numbing - cattle class. I have to travel to London frequently from Bristol and complaining about the GWR service is now simply part of the journey, like buying an over-priced ticket.  To quote another post: ‘the seat 'cushion' has little or no padding and the seat back is at a right angle with no recline so it is virtually impossible to relax. I honestly cannot remember having to sit in such an uncomfortable seat on any form of public transport. Everything already looks and feels worn and cheap. GWR has has stripped out all the good bits from their product in the naked pursuit of profit. All rather sad given how wonderful train travel to the West Country used to be in the days when service and quality counted for something. Those days are well and truly over it seems’Not if we all keep complaining ...	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Last time we came down in January there were no steps th get to the top bunk. Don't know if this was a one off or are they all the same? Will try to avoid the Night Sleeper in future. Shame.Online Customer service is awful, they don't seem to know whats going on. We took a trip to London last October, but there were no trains from Reading as a line was down. We arrived 1.1/2 hrs. late. We claimed Compo, sent tickets in and waited.

2019-03-14T07:46:52Z	When she was good, she was very very good, but when she was bad...	My usual use of GWR is to commute between Cheltenham and Gloucester, but most of the time I go the whole way by bike. The train takes 10 minutes and saves a bit of time or trouble when the weather is terrible, and cyclists don't need to reserve a spot for the short trip.A couple of weeks ago, when I had planned a train commute, they announced the next one was running nearly 30 minutes late, so clearly, it made no sense waiting when I could set off directly by bike. I asked the next time if I could simply use my unused ticket from the delayed fare, and the answer was no. They explained I needed to request compensation and buy a new ticket, which I duly did.I photographed my unused ticket from the delay, emailed it to GWR and waited, only to learn they claim to categorically reject any compensation request for less than 60 minutes delay. Since my ticket was completely worthless to me for that trip, I was doubly frustrated by also having wasted the time contacting them.In conclusion, the bus is likely more reliable and costs slightly less, so I will lean towards that option next time I need a motorised way to work. GWR clearly doesn't stand behind its service for commuters.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2
2019-03-14T07:46:52Z	Another day, another cancellation	The service gets worse every year. Today, we were devastated to cancel plans with family due to our train (and the subsequent train) being cancelled at the last minute. Platform staff at Bath Spa were as helpful as they could be and we thanked them for trying to assist us, but ultimately nobody seemed to know what was going on. GWR as a company leaves me exasperated. I'd be more forgiving but I can genuinely barely remember the last time a train was on time and we pay an extortionate amount for this appalling 'service'. Disgracefully, the UK has the highest rail fares in Europe and very little to show for it.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-03-14T07:46:52Z	Pathetic level of service	I have been using GWR trains for my daily commute for the past 6 years and the service quality has declined markedly in that time, to the point where my train running on time has become the exception rather than the norm. Another source of frustration is the lack of information communicated by drivers as to the cause of delays, often you end up on a slow running service without any explanation for the delay. Obviously compensation for this frankly pathetic service hasn't been reflected ina freezing of ticket prices, with above inflation rises still happening annually. The lack of accountability of these companies means they are not incentivized to improve the service, given they have a pretty much captive market.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-03-14T07:46:52Z	Toxically bad customer service	"Their online and mobile apps are distinctly flakey. I couldn't access an e-ticket I bought and their support team were completely unable to help.  Worse, stuck with a ticket I couldn't collect and therefore couldn't use, they said they couldn't offer an alternative. I would have to buy a new one and they would refund the price of the old one (which of course they had already collected the payment for off my card).  Needless to say, the refund never came through.  I have spent ages speaking to ""Customer Services"" who are not able to help, but refer me to other parts of the organisation, including Web Support - who of course are not authorised to make refunds.Bottom line: you may be forced to travel with these cowboys, but do not under any circumstances buy your tickets online from GWR - use Virgin or any other operator's website instead."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-01-21T14:56:18Z	GWR Poor service	GWR have a Quiet Coach on the new trains but no longer make announcements reminding people that they need to be quiet in the coach.There are no signs on the windows only a small discrete sign at the back of the coach.  When I asked the ticket inspector  about this he said GWR want to phase out the Quiet Coach as its  too onerous  to manage! Another benefit abolished along with the buffet car. So now my journey may no longer be peaceful with people talking loudly into phones and conducting business meetings for the entire journey.Also when booking tickets on line you are now charged £1 to have tickets posted to you whereas until recently that service was free. The final insult is that I am unable to book my tickets on line despite numerous attempts . Clearly technical problems with the website.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2019-01-21T14:56:18Z	BEWARE - you may be on a train with NO working toilet	During a 2 hour trip to London to meet my son who was buying me lunch for my 70th birthday I went to use the use only toilet, but it was out of order. The ticket inspector told me the nearest working toilet was at Oxford station, half an hour away. Rushed off train at next stop, middle of nowhere and raining, and had to go in a field. Complained to GWR who told me there was always one working toilet (implying that I must be lying to them), no apology, no offer of refund. Needless to say I missed my lunch. The fact that I am a pensioner with health issues is irrelevant. Did you know that IT IS LEGAL to run a train with no toilet facilities ?

There was no mention that I could not change or amend my ticket so I proceeded to book my journey. Unfortunately I can not travel on those dates and have encountered some of the most unhelpful rude and frankly dishonest staff whilst trying to change the booking by a day each way it has been one of the worst experiences trying to get anyone from the company to help me. Euston Station ticket staff are awful and the teams that man the 0345 7000125 Customer Services line are really unhelpful the whole experience has been a nightmare and it seems I've been swindled out of £78.

2019-01-21T14:56:18Z	Deplorable service	I recently wrote to GWR regarding my appalling experiences trying to get to and from work traveling from Bridgwater to Exeter. Firstly the set timetable is awful. If there are delays which happens more than 50% of the time I often have to wait more than an hour and a half for a service in freezing conditions. Although independent most coffee shops close well before 8pm. Making this a long, cold, miserable journey day in and day out. I wrote of my experiences to GWR who then took a fortnight to respond with a very long sugar coated feedback explaining this and that etc without really addressing any of the issues or solving them. In addition to this when trains are repeatedly deplorably late ticket collectors with warm smug faces continue to move through the train checking tickets. This is just unacceptable. I have honoured my contract by purchasing a ticket for my journey, GWR it's time you honoured your part of the contract by providing a service. Not doing so is equal to theft. I can not stand this situation any longer and thankfully I shall move house in 2019 to be nearer to Exeter where I will no longer need to use the train anymore. A local bus will take me to and from work. I really have had enough.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2019-01-21T14:56:18Z	Cheap, terrible, nasty	First experience of using the newly branded GWR trains.  Awful experience.  Taking my family to London for a couple of days which the train ride in the past would have been a nice added experience.  Not any more!Boarded the new train, instantly disappointed with the look and feel of it.  Cheap and nasty is how I would describe it.  Terrible throughout.  Feels like a cheap, sub par bottom of the range car.  Hard seats, awful material, cheap plastic everywhere.  WiFi doesn’t work, the toilets are absolutely tiny!!Quickly learned, adding to the hell of it that there is no buffet cart any more, just a trolley with noting on it.  No breakfast items at all.  Low stock of other things and as usual, extortionately priced!! Wouldn’t mind paying if it was nice and the experience was a positive one but it’s not.Just another terrible review from what I’ve already read on here!! Very disappointing.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

However, I had to catch a GWR train from Cheltenham Spa to London Paddington and was very pleasantly surprised! The train wasn't cramped at all, it was spacious, clean, staff were friendly, there was a food and drink trolley, there were plenty of seats and free wi-fi! GWR, you are Crosscountry's polar opposite and I am very glad that you provided the train for today's journey!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	5

Seriously all they seem to have done is take a normal cattle wagon, sorry standard class carriage and remove a seat from each row so it’s 2-1 not 2-2, all they’ done is widen the aisle! Also in first all you get now between cardiff and London is a cup of coffee, no crisps/nuts/cold drinks/sandwiches and the trolley only went past twice. Utterly abysmal. Not worth the extra £200ish on average that it costs over a standard ticket. I don’t understand how this company hopes to prosper by abusing its customers - do they hate their passengers?!?!

2019-01-21T14:56:18Z	Yet another jaw-dropper...	Here I am again to share my latest jaw-dropping GWR horror story.Remember back in September when one of their new trains trashed the power lines and consequently wrote off the Paddington service for a day? Well I was one of the thousands of poor sods that day consequently unable to make it to London. So I needed to claim a refund on my £92.00 off-peak ticket and travelcard. (that's right, nearly £100 to go less than 100 miles on public transport). You'll be unsuprised to hear that claiming a refund from GWR is a bit of an obstacle course. First you have to find what type of screw-up you are claiming for and whether you are eligible for your money back. Once you're through that it's on to the claim itself. First an online form is required to be completed which is sent to their refunds department. The same form then needs to be printed out and, along with the original tickets (not copies) and a separate form displaying the claim reference, the whole lot posted to a freepost address. I dutifully carried out this astonishing Kafkaesque ritual and waited...And waited...And waited...(be patient, they must have had thousands of claims to process from that appalling day...)And waited...Until finally, today an email arrived. I read it and this is what it said:Dear Mr XXXXXXXXXXXXXRE : Your booking reference XXXXXXXThank you for contacting Great Western Railway requesting a refund on your journey tickets.In order to process a refund it is a condition of UK rail retailing rules that the original tickets must be returned to us within 28 days of the planned travel date.Unfortunately we are not able to process your refund request as we have not received your original tickets. Please note that ‘scanned’ tickets or ticket images are not considered to be the original ticket and therefore a refund will not be processed on these.Kind regardsGWR Refund TeamI am literally running out of coping strategies to deal with this.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2018-12-04T19:26:12Z	Unbelievably terrible company.  Treats disabled passengers with distain	Coach C for disabled people reading to Bristol is right at the end of the train.  No wheelchair was supplied although booked and I struggled with rollator to get to the coach.The adjacent seat was occupied by a young mother with a three month old child.  The child started to cry, quietly at first and then loudly.  The coach had a QUIET COACH notice, a man started to berate the poor mother and another woman in turn had a furious confrontation with the man.  I am 80 and had no problem with the child crying.I emailed GWR and received a reply over a week later (website claims to answer emails from disabled passengers within 24 hours) denying this was a quiet coach and not commenting about the carriage being at the end of the train and asking me for proof of my journey.  I sent my GWR referenced Disabled Booking reservation but this cut no ice and three emails and over a month later I can do no more as I don’t have the tickets or ticket reference number but I di provide proof of my journey on that date.I can understand the terrible rating that GWR has received on Trust Pilot and wish that one could give a minus star	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2018-12-04T19:26:12Z	Expensive and terrible	I regularly travel from Cheltenham to Paddington. In the last few months I've had 3 journeys which have been delayed for over an hour. Whilst I understand that this can happen for many reasons, the process of getting a refund for this is appalling. You are constantly ignored, lied to and given the run-around, resulting in multiple phone calls and time wasted. It took me 3 months to get a refund.The new Hitachi trains running on this service are terrible too. The seats are like sitting on wood. There's no cushioning to speak of which at the end of a 2 hour+ journey really takes its toll.Then there's the price. Even on off-peak pricing it's slightly cheaper to drive and pay London parking rates, which is what I'll now start doing.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Every time I have taken a train in the last 6 months from Paddington to Chippenham or on return (off peak times) it has been standing room only. The company that owns GWR made a net profit of £116m last year. GWR: Is it really acceptable to continue to fail in your basic delivery of service, regularly cancel trains, not provide sufficient seating, and raise prices, all while paying your shareholders fat dividends?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

The train comprised of 3 coaches, despite warnings of high demand, due to the Christmas Market.  On the return journey our seats were not labelled and occupied. The occupants refused to move, meaning my disabled husband had to stand for an hour,  before a seat became free. Why didn't GWR restrict passenger numbers or run additional coaches?

2018-12-04T19:26:12Z	I use the Nailsea to Paddington route…	"I use the Nailsea to Paddington route on a fairly regular basis using Trainline to book my advance tickets. In the past this has been a very good service but having used this process recently it has turned into a nightmare! GWR has recently started using the new Hitachi trains which has turned the booking process into an absolute joke!!! Part of the booking online allows you to choose forward facing, quiet carriage, table seat, etc., but either GWR have not cottoned on to the fact that the seating profile is completely different to the old trains or they just could not give a damn about customers using their so called ""service"". Briefly, when we boarded the train from Bristol we found that the ""reserved seats were not forward facing,did not have a table,etc., A very helpful GWR lady did tell us to change to any forward facing seats that had a green light above them which, because the train was pretty quiet, we were able to do. However, on our return from Paddington several days later the train was very busy and our ""reserved seats"" had been taken up. As there were no reserved labels attached to the seats despite telling the people in them they were our seats they refused to move. This must happen on a very regular basis and I can imagine tempers get frayed. Eventually,we were very fortunate to get some seats but only after some time searching. We were in the last carriage on a 9 coach train and when the inspector came round he told us we would have to walk virtually the whole length of the train to get off at Nailsea which could only accommodate the front four carriages. With two suitcases that was not an easy task for two elderly passengers. With regard to previous posts concerning the seats I must admit that for someone with an ongoing back problem I found the firmness of the seating was, in fact, good for my posture and had not problem with them although they do, admitedley have little padding. In conclusion, if you are travelling on this route with the new Hitachi carriages don't bother requesting the options advertised as you will be very disappointed as they don't exist unless you are lucky enough to get on an old train. Do GWR advertise this fact? Of course they don't you are just left to get on with it and continue paying their exhorbitant fares for a vastly inferior service."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

I can’t count how many times I’ve been left at Bath Spa by the 17.38 and been told I have to wait for the 18.02 because we couldn’t all fit on a 3 COACH RUSH HOUR SERVICE.

Many other train operators manage to offer reasonably priced tickets and to keep delays to a minimum - why can't you manage this?  The new GWR website is so bad I have stopped using it to buy tickets.  It is confusing and misleading and frequently just doesn't work.

2018-11-05T16:37:52Z	The new trains are very poorly…	The new trains are very poorly designed, and uncomfortable. GWR has clearly tried to pack more seats into the carriages to make more money. That has meant seats that are vertical, on the Ryanair model. The toilets are cramped, meaning they become covered in urine very quickly. Disgusting. And no more buffet cars, so good luck if you don't want a coffee when the trolley comes by - if it does at all. All this before I even start on punctuality.The old trains may have been 40 years old, but they were much better than the new ones	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Arrival should have been  at 7pm ;but we arrived around 8.30pm. No proper explanation given apart from the fact that the train stopped for a good half hour.After it had arrived late a member of staff said it was due to one of the doors being faulty. Also when I went to use the toilet a lady had come out to tell me it was disgusting and advised me not to go in. I had to walk down a few carriages to find another one I could use.  Coming back the following week our train left Penzance at 4pm ;sceduled to arrive at 9pm.  It was around 10.30 it arrived.   Also the carriage we were in was absolutly cold. Yet walking through the other carriages it was lovely and warm.  Not a great trip either way. I think they need to get their act together.

Travelled long distance several times, frequently no buffet service.Seen the new long distance trains? They look lovely I will admit. But the seats are firkin horrible. You'll get to your destination needing a chiropractor. Seats are rock hard and most uncomfortable.Call centre staff try but they are fighting a losing battle.

I’m a regular disabled customer,  I travel Swansea to London return often for hospital appointments. I find that the service from the staff at Paddington to be amazing, In particular the disabled assistance staff and the ticket office.On Monday my hospital appointment was running late by 25 mins resulting in me missing the 445pm to Swansea, Manjit in the GWR ticket office in Paddington could see how much pain and suffering I was in. Showing a letter from hospital confirming my appointment ran late, he wrote me a note allowing me to use the peak 545 service to Swansea at no additional charge. Another time a few months ago; I was left in a wheelchair due to an operation going wrong, there was limited space for wheelchair due to change of train so GWR upgraded me and my mother to first class. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT AS OF LATE THE SEAT RESERVATIONS, NEVER SEEM TO BE APPLIED, as a disabled customer I’m unable to stand for the long jounrey so vital that I get a seat, my cardiac disability isn’t visible so people don’t automatically give up their seats for me. There isn’t often any Trajn staff present on packed trains to help you get customers in priority seats to move, which is why I have given 4 stars not 5.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	4

The seats are not up to standards, it was like sitting on a school assembly chair, bolt upright and within 25 minutes of the journey my back was aching, the legroom is good though.  The ride is bumpy, even rocky and you really feel the vibration from the rails coming through to the car. The seat reservation was chaotic....I sat in a seat with no reservation card in the back of the seat, so I assumed the seat was not reserved, I've traveled with GWR long enough now to know this is standard, on 2 separate occasions I had to move because the seats were reserved, but how would you possibly know this if the reservation card wasn't in the back of the seat, absolutely useless - customers were also having to stand.  I despair of GWR, they are a shocking company with very little to be proud of, but still they choose to be totally oblivious of customers complaints/concerns, seem to treat customer with contempt and just carry on as if everything is hunky dory, wake up, it's not okay and far from okay.............it's no less than a bad kind of arrogance.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

This is the problem with monopolies and lack of competition - companies can do what they want and nobody can do anything about it.Back in December 2016 I was left stranded at Taunton rail station for 12 hours and then was told no other train was coming and no other transport was being organised to pick us up, so I had to pay over £100 for a taxi back home. I was promised half my fair £120 and a £50 voucher, which I have never received. It's now August 2018 and I am still trying to get this cash back. They seem to think I magically cashed a cheque they never even sent out. I have literally spent hours on the phone to this company.

I suspect that the employees are at the end of their tether and it certainly shows. That said they are making money and effectively have a monopoly so providing a decent service is of little consequence. Cancelled trains, trains broken down,staff shortages. All issues. But the shareholder dividend is probably ok so why would they change anything?

When it does turn up it is already full and you are forced to stand in hot cramped conditions and the best thing is that they expect you to pay them for being treated like a prisoner.I suggest this is not fit for purpose and until things are working properly they should offer free rail travel but of course this won’t happen and the bare faced cheeky sods will put prices up again next year.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2018-08-18T06:38:08Z	Four hour journey, first class ticket, standing all the way...	Last month I travelled from London Paddington to Bodmin Parkway (11th July 12:30 train) and given the length of the journey I decided to buy a first class ticket to make the journey more comfortable (possibly the first time I’ve bought a first class ticket).When we boarded the train we were told by the onboard staff that despite having reserved seats the company hadn’t attached enough carriages and so we would have to stand (I had a non reserved seat, but there were plenty in the carriage arguing over the same ‘reserved’ seat). As the train pulled into Reading and Didcott more passengers got on which only increased the overcrowding.The staff on the carriage were professional, friendly and very apolgetic for the situation (one lady who got on at Reading and worked for GWR head office, tried her best to make sure everyone was as comfortable as possible with food and drinks). The train Manager provided us with a code on our ticket and told us to send a picture into GWR for a full refund, which I felt I deserved after standing for four hours with a first class ticket.Anyway to cut a long story short, a MONTH later (apparently they are experiencing a high number of ‘enquiries’) I’ve just heard back from GWR to say that they don’t normally give refunds for ‘overcrowding’ but are prepared to give me 50% of a standard ticket coming to £25. My guess is they knew it would be cheaper to pay out on ticket refunds (or not as it transpires) than to attach the correct number of carriages to this train - this is their business model. I wasn’t actually too ‘put out’ by the situation on the day, but their follow up to it has been so poor I thought I would break the habit of a lifetime and write a review. Except for the train crew, VERY POOR all round!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2018-08-18T06:38:08Z	A Travesty of A Rail Service	"The GWR web site is very often difficult to use, to navigate and frequently crashes despite repeated updates and modifications to the site. The trains are almost invariably late and frequently very overcrowded at peak times. Often one will often find that a promised 10 coach ""new"" train has been reduced to five coaches without explanation leading to passengers being dangerously rammed. The toilets are very often filthy or blocked. It is unusual for the taps to provide water to wash one's hands with in the old rolling stock which still plies the line. Trains are too often cancelled due to a shortage of drivers who plainly feel £60,000 per annum is poor reward for working for GWR. The staff, to their credit, are almost always apologetic for the appalling service offered daily. And yet the fares continue to soar. The service offered by the rail network in general is an insult but what GWR offer is a travesty of a service. What is so sad is that the service gets worse with each passing year despite the surely handsome dividends passed on to shareholders. Passengers simply feel exploited and robbed."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Constant delays because of broken trains, broken signals, terrible line management,  terrible decisions by the signallers. Nobody at GWR CARES!!! We have had every excuse imaginable for delays. Tracks too hot, tracks too cold, tracks too slippery, too many leaves, train cant get up the hill,  can't find the train driver, train driver at the wrong station and ooohh so many more!! Everyone at GWR should be ashamed!! You are a customer service industry and you provide a one out of 10 service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2018-08-18T06:38:08Z	Inefficient and incompetent	"Inefficient and incompetent at dealing with problems. My normal 90 minute journey to Oxford from Worcester took over four hours! Signals failures meant a shuttlebus from Worcester to Evesham; this took well over 90 minutes to appear and initially went to the wrong station!! Passengers were dumped at Evesham, with the promise of a train there, only to find we were stranded. The 12.26 and 14.25 trains to Oxford/Paddington both cancelled. The toilets were locked. One man struggled to cope with a barrage of complaints from passengers travelling both north and south. Eventually a train arrived. Instead of reaching Oxford at about 11.30, I got to my destination shortly before 3 o'clock.Horror of horrors! On the return journey, after passengers piled onto the 18.17 train at Oxford, we were told to all get off again and catch the already packed 18.50 to Worcester as there was ""a problem with the driver""!!!! Passengers wanting to travel on to Hereford were told they couldn't. This train terminated at Worcester.What IS the problem with this rubbish rail company that they can't run a reliable service? The sad thing is that these delays and failure to resolve them quickly are regular occurrences on this line. Many passengers just seem resigned to them now."" It's normal."" Well, it's not. It's a travesty of a service."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

On the return journey from Taunton the train was 15 minutes late (also back at Plymouth) and, at the last minute, it arrived at a different platform! I had a reservation for coach A 60 only for the train to display a 'no reservations' notice in its windows. I had to stand again to Exeter with people again in the aisles in the carriages and between them; health and safety? Also, to cap it all, there was no air-conditioning in the carriage when I eventually found a seat!!! In fact, it was announced that the air-conditioning was not working in 4 of the 8 carriages and that on an extremely hot day!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

No stars would be more appropriate.Having travelled on rail networks for over 35 years I cannot recall one as bad as GWR.Lack of staff means trains are often cancelled, delayed or with shorter carriages. People are regularly asked to stand if they do manage to get on one of the trains. The delay refund service takes months, not 10 days as indicated on their website, and overall this is the worst rail network in existence.The managing director needs to seriously re-think his business model as if this company needs to be put out of it's misery.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2018-07-18T11:28:32Z	Constant issues	Every single time I travel on GWR there is an issue. I travel regularly from Truro to London for work. The air con is broken, trains are cancelled regularly, trains are overcrowded leaving people standing and sitting in the aisles (often because of cancellations) the coffee shop is closed due to lack of staff, or the coffee shop hasn’t been restocked, or the coffee machine is broken etc etc. Recently a visiting friend who is in a wheelchair  was left having to change trains without the pre requested assistance - thankfully other passagers were kind enough to help. It’s highly unreliable and inconsistent in its service. Which doesn’t make for a comfortable or confident journey.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2018-07-18T11:28:32Z	DISGUSTING AND POOR SERVICE	"Travelled to London on the 29/6/18 for an overnight break. Was due to return on the 30.6.18 on the  4:12 from Paddington to Cardiff however because of your poorly trained and abusive staff I missed the train. The saga began with the platform being announced and on the departures board, where there was a massive surge of people running for the train and staff hurrying people along, I guess as it had gone 4:12 they were up against it and wanted the train out ASAP. My ticket would not go through the machine, I went to the male staff member on the gates, his badge said Stephen. He told me I did not have the correct ticket ?? and brushed me aside, I was panic stricken, my friends were already through and he would not help me. A female staff member looked at my ticket and let me through stating the ticket was fine?? However they would not let me on the train and it left. I was shocked and distraught. Stephen was laughing and mocking me as I returned to the gates. I did not think he was professional and told him so. The female staff member said I could get the next train. I asked for his name and he went ballistic, shouting at me and came through the gate right in my face shouting"" Stephen"" . I felt very intimidated and scared of him. He was very aggressive towards me. I left the area as he continued to shout at me and then justifying himself to the female staff member who was very quiet and stood with her head down. Very unhelpful situation, he needs training in how to deal with CUSTOMERS.. if he is on the frontline of your service you have a big problem. Stephen is lucky I made it home on time to be able to top up my insulin or he would have been looking at far worse charges. Out of principal the  next time I intend to travel I will use a bus company and factor in the time difference as part of my trip. Disgusting way to be treated when I paid enough for a service that I did not get. SHAMEFUL. BTW - your air conditioning is poor and staff announcements are a waste of time as they can't be heard.... I had to ask what the announcement was about  and was told that if I wanted refreshment I needed to get off the train at the next stop and go to the first 5 cars where there was refreshment trolley ????  Was it because ""the trolley"" doesn't fit throughout your trains or that they just couldn't be bothered to come through the cars???  again a poor service on what looked to me to be a relatively new train. LAUGHABLE."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Who wouldn't?Connection at Bristol delayed, delayed, delayed until there was a platform absolutely full of people. After half an hour a tiny three carriage local trainpulled in. At the sign of a dangerous rush to board the staff shouted that another train was leaving for Cardiff on the other platform. Omitting to mention it called at every tiny station on the way. Arrived in Cardiff over an hour after expected time and missed half the show. Ever thought of putting extra trains on for a big gig rather than fewer?Return journey was completely cancelled, although no notifications sent so we didn't know till at the station. Fortunately we had arrived half an hour early to the station, so managed to get a GWR posh train for one stop ( It'll be great when you get those seats finished) then directed to bus for Bristol Templemeads. Which went to Bristol Parkway. Further train to Templemeads then a long wait for the train home. Late again.Passengers helped the two older ladies whose husbands were waiting for them somewhere the train wasn't now going and the lady on sticks whose carefully planned one train journey was now two trains and bus and all those stairs.And of course, no recompense as we don't live in London. A curious addendum to the Terms and Conditions.

I see this lady nearly every day and she has amazing customer service!! Please employ more people like her I wish I got/noticed her name but everyday I'm always in a rush but tonight showed the level of customer service!!! Please call me if you want me to confirm but I will personally bring her some recognition for her actions tonight and she was so quick to help and in customer service it's expected and never realised I was on the the Reading basingstoke arriving at approx 21:30 wearing red with red earings black jeans and black/white Nike trainers with a little pink.

2018-06-12T18:40:22Z	AWFUL SERVICE	AWFUL SERVICE. On the 28th may 2017 I was delayed from Southampton Central to Cardiff Central on the 11:54 and then the 12:54 services. I put in a request for a delay repay 1-2 days later for being over 3hours delayed. The 13th October was the first time I heard back from GWR about my request for a delay repay, I was made aware that ‘I regret that a technical issue meant that your claim form was held by our spam filter, which has delayed our reply. This has now been resolved, however, I am sorry for the additional frustration this has no doubt caused.’ and ‘I can confirm your claim has now been processed and a payment of £40.00 has been issued in the form of cheque. This includes an additional £10.00 in recognition of the delay in processing you claim. You will receive this cheque within 2 weeks’. Having already waited 5 month to hear from GWR, to date I am STILL waiting for my repayment. I have been on the phone 8/9 times to GWR to revolve this and have been told over and over the same thing. I have been asked to confirm my email address and house address several times when called and have been told the delay was due to you needing a confirmation of postal address. This has NOT changed in the last 10 month and I have confirmed this EVERYTIME I have called. I think to customer service is awful and the lack of commutation in the department is discussing. Every time I have called I have spent 30-60minutes on the phone trying to resolve this and quite frankly I now do not think £10 is ‘recognition’ enough for the delay in processing this claim and the time I have spent on the phone. I now have 4 different reference number due to the inefficient system at GWR. I cannot stress enough my frustration with you as a company, From this experience I will try to avoid GWR at all costs.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2018-06-12T18:40:22Z	Truly terrible service in all respects	6 out of 8 of my last journeys either cancelled or delayed. Station staff unhelpful and rude. Taxis put on when train cancelled did not arrive. On one occasion train so full it turned people away from boarding. A very terrible all round service	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2018-06-12T18:40:22Z	Trains cancelled every weekend	"Trains cancelled every weekend, also being told ""don't travel"" and to ""try and get a refund"" due to trains being rammed during the May bank holiday Saturday. Just because I am disabled and need to be sat down. But they don't seem to make any ""reasonable adjustments"" or give a damn about the Disabled People's Protection Policy!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2018-06-12T18:40:22Z	No stars, extortionate and rude	"Just like everyone else I am only leaving one star because there is no option for zero. I travel every week for work, Mon - Fri. The way the season ticket is set up I am forced to buy weekend tickets as well, although they are a complete waste as I have never used them. I spend £210 per month on these tickets and yet the service is appalling. If you want to guarantee you arrive at work on time take the train an hour early because the trains are cancelled, (train faults, signalling faults, no driver, trespasser or line side fire on the other side of the country to name some of the excuses which have been provided). For a train at 5:25 - specifically 'meeting the needs' of the commuters they lay on 2 pacer carriages from the 1980s and expect 1000 people to cram in. That is a horrific journey, avoid if at all possible. Standing room only, crushed up against the other passengers. They say they have no other carriages available. I have never travelled on that service and found it anything other than overcrowded. Certainly not worth the £210 monthly fare.When you ask for compensation for being hours late for work or having disruption and delay they send sarcastic and unhelpful written responses which say 'we don't compensate season ticket holders'. (They reserve the right to balance the averages of all of the journeys made over the last month before deciding on their own success). It basically says they care not a jot about the customer. I, like others on this forum, have been delivered to a random station and told to disembark as the train has now been cancelled. This particular station had no toilets, no cafe, no open waiting room and barely any seats on the platform. There was an hour and half wait until the next possible service. What kind of service cancels a full train of people half way through their journey? I have also fallen foul of the ""assured the train is running, (wait on the platform for 20mins). Tannoy announcement, ""your train is cancelled"" (4 mins before it is due to depart)"". This is a service which is woefully under provided, over priced and very poorly run. The company needs to remember that their customers matter. Their customer service is awful. The state of the trains are awful. They changed their name to ""Great Western Railway"" - the arrogance of that is staggering when compared to the service provided."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2018-05-08T13:41:03Z	Weekend cancellations	Service is so bad between Paddington and Bath that I have decided to drive, which will be cheaper, more comfortable and above all more reliable. These weekend cancellations when the weather is good are a disgrace. Train managers tell me that do not need to work at weekends because they get paid same rate as overtime during the week (which they can get plenty of), so when the weather is good, they would prefer not to work at weekends. When you can get a seat on the new trains, they are so uncomfortable that I am getting back problems. Remove GWR franchise immediately, they must surely be in breach of their conditions.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2018-05-08T13:41:03Z	New trains in dire nead of more comfortable seating	I spend £2000 a month on GWR rail from Paddington-Cardiff services sometimes more, the new GWR 800 trains are constantly late running often arriving in Cardiff from London for at least 80% of the time between 15-35 min late. The seats are horrific and Solid with Zero comfort compared with the older HST125 trains.I personally will not buy another 1st class ticket not even if it’s £15 more expensive (advanced fare) due to the First class seats being the same quality as the 2nd class seats with the exception of a Head-pad taped to the rear or the seat, again compare with the older 125 trains with luxurious leather seating 1st class to me is a thing of the passed on GWR.I travelled in the new GWR class 387 electric units between Slough and Reading and thier a lot better quality than these new intercity class 800 trains .We’re paying lots of money for less quality come on GWR pull your fingers out and provide more comfortable seating as the seating in the new class 800 trains are atrocious	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Passengers paying for very expensive seats on peak trains and having to stand in conditions worse than cattle - is this acceptable?   To add to this yesterday I arrived home nearly 2 hours late due to an endless list of train faults, lack of drivers and signalling problems.

And when traveling on GWR at the time, despite paying a lot of money for the ticket, commuting back from Paddington to Reading, for about 6 months, anytime between about 3:30pm and 7pm, I would be unable to get a seat and it was borderline being able to even board the train.

What is billed as First Class seats are now inferior in quality to the second class seats in the previous trains. So in reality GWR are now charging a first class fare for a second class seats and those in second class are getting a third rate seat quality.They should advertise Second Class and Third Class as the seat options and also point out that the ride in the new trains is hard, uncomfortable and inferior in every way. Also the train buffets have all been removed. So, millions invested, much time spent awaiting the new trains; all to deliver a much worse service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

At least 4 times a week a train will be cancelled (no driver) or severely delayed. There is no where to sit and the over crowding is horrendous, tempers are being lost, people fainting.

I pay over a GBP 1000 a month for a sub standard poor, dirty unreliable service between Newbury and London Paddington. A ridiculous amount but first class is the only way to guarantee a seat, one hopes!Traveling last Thursday despite having a reserved seat organised everyday, there were no reservations at all and so had to stand until Reading!  Guard was shocked but the train was very busy. On top of this, there was no power in the sockets, both loos at either end of the carriage were blocked on leaving Paddington and no heating in many of the carriages.A claim was submitted by email for a full refund and some complete idiot seems to think all was well and that a refund is not justified!

2018-04-10T11:46:41Z	Hopeless web site	I only use GWR 4 or 5 times a month in the main for  journeys from Maidenhead to Reading and to Gatwick.  On the whole and over the last 5 years or so the train service has been decent with only the odd bad experience usually due to bad weather or some technical issue. Based on other reviews here perhaps I have been lucky but for me 4* is fair. However, one very poor aspect of GWR is their web site, poor and illogical navigation and often even a simple transaction needs to be repeated before it will work.  I regularly book a railcard journey to Gatwick but each time the booking process through the system varies and it rarely works first time.  If anyone from GWR is reading this I highly recommend asking a 'normal' user to try booking a Senior railcard for 2 people from Maidenhead to Gatwick and then pay by credit card.  They will not be able to do it, as they should be able, in one simple transaction.  GWR, your IT department sucks.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	4

2018-02-11T15:20:34Z	Terrible new GWT trains	The new GWT trains on the Bristol Bath to London line are shockingly bad. The seats seem to be modelled on Victorian school room desks - extremally hard. I have not taken a trip without seeing at least one passenger suffering from back pain. The toilets are filthy and half the size of the old ones, with no where to hang your coat or bag. The buffet car seems to have been abandoned. The quiet carriage is only labelled as such on the door, in small print. As such, most passengers in it are unaware and so the place is loud with no clear grounds that it shouldn’t be. The reservation system is unclear - you can only see if a seat is booked when squinting at a tiny digital display above the aisle. So useless if you’re looking through windows on a crowded platform trying to find a spare seat. A smaller point, but very ugly interiors. I’ve travelled GWR regularly for twenty years and I am utterly confused as to why they abandoned a previously good train design for these.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2018-02-11T15:20:34Z	Very bad	This was my First ever experience with GWR and unfortunately it was Awful. I have nothing good to say about my trip from Portsmouth harbour to Bristol, apart from getting me there safely and on time there was nothing else good about this service. The train was very cold and very dirty, not to mention extremely dated. Not a comfortable journey - no leg room extremely cramped.  On top of this the tap in the toilet was broken so I couldn’t even wash my hands after using the bathroom. There was also no working WiFi as advertised. Would not recommend. Has a lot of catching up to do with other providers such as SWT.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2018-02-11T15:20:34Z	Already dreading morning commute	Already dreading morning commute. Dreadful overcrowding on 8.02 out of Maidenhead to London Paddington. Train comes in with loads of people standing on it already.  Then loads of people crowding through doors pushing each other. This replaced the 7.59 which had some capacity on arrival at Maidenhead. We were promised improvements after Christmas but things now positively dreadful and dangerous. People pushing and shoving and tempers frayed. We should not be subjected to this.Also EVERY single journey I have taken into London since Christmas has been delayed.  During every single journey the driver announces that we've been stopped at a red light.  Then the train is delayed. Depressing +++++   Yet always 3 guards to catch fare dodgers at barriers at Maidenhead essentially doing nothing except warming themselves on an electric heater. Why aren't the regulators doing something about such a dangerous overcrowded service? Perhaps they're waiting until someone topples over the edge or assaults another passenger out of sheer frustration. I am writing this in upset and anger because a fellow passenger was very rude to me. I was standing and he was sitting at a table. I asked him if I could put my tea on the table and he ignored me. After I put my tea on the table he was very rude to me.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

What a time to choose! First class was heaving full and the rest of the train impossible to find a seat. Guard said things would improve after Pewsey (who lives there?). He was right and there were seats but by then others had taken everyone else’s reserved seats. Chaos! Not a way to run a railway. Bring back Brunel.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2018-02-11T15:20:34Z	Inefficient	Every weekend it’s pretty impossible traveling to Swansea from London. Planned closure, crew shortage, staff not going to work... but they still charge you £90. Life is easy without competitors	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2018-02-11T15:20:34Z	Usually a good service	Suprised to see so many negative reviews on here. I get GWR from West Drayton to Ealing Broadway (and back) regularly and have found the service to be reliable on the whole. The 8:10am from West Drayton would usually turn up early and depart at 8:10am on the dot. Of the times where there have been delays, most have not been for longer than 5 minutes and longer delays only in truly exceptional circumstances. Also trains are clean, comfortable, and I can usually get a seat even at peak hours. The only reason for not giving GWR 5* is the occasional short forming of carriages which creates dangerously overcrowded situations and the change in timetable without seemingly any annoucement.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	4

I suppose with no other competition and no other choice they seem to do what they want.£124.30 to travel from Taunton to Paddington on a Wednesday morning is quite honestly daylight robbery - this journey takes 1h 46mins.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

What do GWR promise? A reliable way for me and my fellow commuters to get to wherever we need to go everyday. However, the trains are nearly always late, they are overpriced for what they are, and they are not comfortable. If you can avoid GWR, do it at any chance.

On the outbound journey I lost my outbound ticket (I still had the return and receipt), the ticket inspector on the second leg was OK and having showed him the return had no problem. Arriving at Reading was a different matter. With no ticket I was unable to exit the station, I explained the situation to a member of staff but he refused me exit and said that I needed to go to the ticket office. At the office I explained what had happened and showed them the receipt and return ticket (day return), they insisted that I needed a ticket and charged me £6.30 for the replacement.

2018-02-11T15:20:34Z	Diabolical service	Diabolical service and an extortionate pricing model. I thought South Eastern Trains was bad until I was forced into using this dreadful company.  The staff are indifferent, safe in the knowledge that their union will defend them even if they don’t bother turning up to drive a rush hour train. The trains are packed and late most of the time, the organisation at Paddington is a joke and the refund scheme is skewed so heavily in favour of GWR that it is almost impossible for a season ticket holder to obtain a refund for late arrivals.Needless to say I expect GWR will take full advantage of the price hikes and add as much as it can to its already outrageous ticket prices.Shame on you GWR. I sincerely hope you lose your mandate next time it is up for renewal you are a truly awful company.As a result of your incompetence the already limited time I have with my children in the evening is routinely reduced.

A weekend Xmas Market trip from London to Bath totally ruined by having to stand both ways on an overcrowded, packed train, including a dangerous return journey squashed into the cold, draughty area between carriages where the floor moves constantly...with NOTHING except a broken piece of rubber sealant to hold onto for over TWO HOURS... and to top it all, they still include First Class carriages that could take some of the overflow.

Two weeks running have bought First Class tickets only to have a jam packed train with people standing and even sitting in the aisles.No one even checked any tickets and there were no seat reservations either.

No one stopped other people squashing on at every station... and when the train went up a slight incline, it was shuddering and there was a burning smell.I love travelling by train usually, but I think I'll fly into cornwall next time I go :(	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

So all journey takes about 1,50 minutes. After one hour train Manager Louise came to us to check the tickets and I asked when the trolley is coming, she answered and left. In about 10 minutes Louise came back to us with the coffee cup and saved my mood even without knowing why I need that coffee so much . GWT should be happy to have that kind of Manager.

The only posters (2 large ones) concerned the dire consequences of what would happen if you didn't have a ticket.  It took 3 emails to get them to address my question and eventually this is what they said""These boards are put in place to remind customer to purchase tickets before they board our service to avoid getting a penalty fare.

Let everyone on the train and only realised they should have been vacating the train once the passengers told them. The guards on the platform claimed they were putting on bus replacement service...which never turned up either. Just one example of many similar occurrences.Trains are more delayed than on time-and every evening the trains in the Bath area are totally rammed with passengers. There should be health and safety standards limiting this-especially as there are no hand rails to hold on to and the carriages are showing signs of age. I’ve seen people fainting and taken ill. The situation is getting worse all the time. Apart from the frustration felt by passengers, at some stage there will be a serious accident resulting in fatalities.I feel really sorry for the platform staff-who all seem so dedicated	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2017-11-28T17:41:12Z	Can the wifi be improved?	The trains are of variable quality but are improving as new stock is rolled ou. I am never sure, however, whether a train will turn up with 1,2,3 or 4 carriages. The train can get very crowded when there are few carriages.Wifi is, in principle, a good thing. I have, however, only rarely been able to access it. I sometimes get as far as the sign on screen and then ...... nothing. Is there enough bandwidth? Most of the time the facility may as well not be there. It is better not to offer the facility than have one that, mostly, does not work. On the other hand, I suppose, it whiles away 20 minutes or so before I eventually give up.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	3

How can such a bad service be priced so high is beyond me. The trains that do turn up are filthy and overcrowded. 'We are sorry to announce that the 9:07 service to Westbury has been cancelled. This is due to more trains than usual needing repairs.' I do not get this excuse. They say it every time.

Even given a reference number etc. In a later call it appears that the reservation no longer existed. In trying to determine which operator dealt with me etc they had a record and recordings of all of my calls but interestingly, not the actual call in which the reservation was made. I have it on my BT statement as to what day and time and duration but no, they say that I didn't make the call. It seems like they found that they'd made an error and chose to remove all evidence.I made a complaint but received a standard scripted reply bearing no reference to the actual complaint.

"I returned from LHR after travelling 8 hours with my 4 year old to hop on a train in Paddington to Exeter with a pre-booked ticket. 90 minutes in, the train manager told me I was on the train an hour earlier than my ticket stated and I was charged a full fare for the trip. When I told him it was a genuine mistake and I didn't think it was reasonable to charge me like that on a Sunday, it became apparent there was no compassion, empathy or understanding and I was forced to pay up. The train manager did not want to provide his full details, but I told him I would file a complaint as the experience was rather distressing for both me and my 4 year old. I sent GWR a detailed e-mail and sent my tickets and a complaint form, only to follow-up a week later to hear that 'ticket policy is the policy'. No refund... Ah well, so be it then...From now onwards I will consider taking the train to London as a last option over car or bus...I was amazed that customer service seems to feature very low on GWR's list. Many times I have had to contend boarding a train without seating available, many times I was confronted with massive delays and never I complained. For once I made a genuine mistake and the ""GWR rules' got enforced without flinching. Dear GWR, you can't really have it both ways. Customers can be understanding and tolerant, but also demand the same courtesy in return at times. It is sad that he company doesn't train their staff in focusing on the customer but just teaches them to enforce the rules and gives them no discretion to find fair and equitable solutions when minor issues arise."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2017-10-19T07:47:52Z	Customer service was left behind on the platform at London Paddington	On outward and onward journey from Paddington to Cornwall WC's not functioning. Seats extremely uncomfortable and space per passenger at table 4 seats unacceptable. Journey started at St Austell and first announcement that there was restaurant car came at 1.45 - not much use as most people had already eaten their lunches. Very small area for luggage and totally inadequate for number of people on train - luggage stacked up in exit doorways from train. Difficult to negotiate and can't be safe to block exit doors. One Good point:  Train delayed but train manager answered all queries and helped with onward journeys.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2017-10-19T07:47:52Z	Major improvements required	I was delayed for over an hour, and they told me the delay was only for two minutes. There is no one to complain to. I phoned up several times, and they kept trying to dissuade me from pursuing it, yet would not deal with the complaint. I have not received any apology or compensation for the fact I had to keep phoning. Awful service, I will not be using them again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2
2017-10-19T07:47:52Z	Awful service- avoid!	"Purchased return to Cornwall from Kent (not first class). On way out  GWR train so crowded people were having to sit in the aisles - so no access to either toilet or purchase of a drink (4hr+ journey). On way back, all the seats appears to have been previously reserved - although many people simply didn't turn up/use the reserved seats. This produced 'seat rage' as people getting on saw others in ""their"" seats and thought they weren't going to get 'their seat' - everyone was British and gave up seats when asked, but what a carry-on. They don't seem to reserve seats like this on Kent/London trains, probably because it doesn't work in practice! Next time I'll give up on my 'green' credentials and just drive - half the cost and less than a quarter of the hassle.And that doesn't include the hassle of actually purchasing the tickets ....."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2017-08-11T10:56:31Z	Uninformed Customer Services	The refund form has 8 boxes for the reference number, but the number on the ticket has 10 digits.Called helpline number and after long delay spoke with a female who could not have cared less and told me I would have to go back to the station and ask them. I would have thought she would have known the answer?And they will be taking £10 for this cxxp?I shall send the ticket back with the form (which, incidentally, has miniscule spaces to write in) and maybe somebody can handle it effectively.

2017-08-11T10:56:31Z	New rolling stock useless for commuters....IMO	Just used a GWR train...which has the latest carriages. Like all other train companies the design is Not fit for commuting. Tables are too narrow, (so you can't put 2 laptops back to back), as the are so narrow if you do use laptop it is too far away to be used comfortably...You have similar issues with single seats... you can just about balance your laptop but it is difficult and uncomfortable to use....for ref I'm 6ft tall so anyone shorter is just wasting their time....TRAINS WILL SOON MAINLY BE USED BY PERSONS ON ROUTE OR RETURNING FROM BUSINESS MEETINGS....SO ESPECIALLY AT PEAK HOURS THEY NEED TO BE LIKE MINI OFFICES. IF THE TRAIN COMPANIES FAIL TO SERVICE THE BUSINESS CROWD...SOMETHINH ELSE WILL... TAKE NOTE ANDXREACY NOW OF FSIL MISERABLY DOEN THE LINE.THEY DO HAVE POWER BUT NO USB SOCKET. ....	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2
2017-08-11T10:56:31Z	God awful	God awful. I bought tickets that were refundable if unused. Turned out that I couldn't travel due to illness so I printed out their refund form and sent it with the unused tickets to them. It's a freepost address but I paid for signed for delivery in case...that was three weeks ago. Great Western say that they haven't processed them yet, but can't say if they've received them or not.Royal Mail tracking shows them as still progressing through their system. My guess is that these characters don't sign for anything and Royal Mail allow that. Meanwhile they keep over £100 of mine. At first they told me it takes 28 days to process refunds, but I called today and I was told '4 to 6 weeks'.I wonder if they'd give me that long to pay the fine if I hopped on one of their trains without a ticket...I just got back from Italy and sincerely hope that our 'Great' Western Railway idiots are learning something in their relationship with Trenitalia.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2017-08-11T10:56:31Z	Still waiting for a refund claimed in …	Still waiting for a refund claimed in early May - although looking at other posts here I'm probably being a little impatient. Saw a piece in Guardian Money about a delayed refund and GWR moved quickly then and added 2 free 1st Class tickets as compensation for delay. Can't wait for my free tickets- might even get a seat for a change from Bath to Paddington!I found an old ticket from 2000 a while ago - peak return at £60! As it's now over 3 times that price quite a shock - wish I was earning 3 times as much as I was 17 years ago.Caught up in the signalling debacle at Paddington a couple of weeks ago - had to stay another night in London, meals, additional parking, more tube fares, taxis, missed meetings etc. Guessing again they'll deduct £10 admin. If it was a flight we'd be properly compensated.As it's an effective monopoly on this route no choice but to use your service - sooner renationalised the better.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2017-08-11T10:56:31Z	Great staff	Staff were helpful, polite and friendly.I travelled First Class(not usual) was sad about the choice of refreshments offered considering the cost of the ticket.I think sandwiches or a panini should be included. There are only so many packets of crisps/nuts, biscuits & cake you can eat.Coffee was dreadful.Service was great offering poor, which is the easier to rectify!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	4

Interesting that the text number given, to Marta on16 th May, and thus for the message I sent has been returned, undeliverable, 4 times.Possibly sums up the incompetence of GWR!So to save time, here it is,Web site atrocious- complicated, unstable and unreliable.See 'Train Line' on how to do it.Explain how having gone to final page (review journey) and you are told you can amend, one does that without going back to square 1.Having gone through the tedious process twice you are then billed for two journeys!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2017-08-11T10:56:31Z	Poor service.	I use their service on daily basis, at least twice a day for 2 years now so feel no rage while writting this review, just got used to it. I was able to get to work and back at majority of times, but often wet to the skin due to overfilled platform on rainy day or due to extremely high temperature in cars during hot days. Front line crew members do their best, but their approach cannot replace exploited equipment and poor logistics. Probably worst value for money you can get.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2017-08-11T10:56:31Z	1 Stars is too high for them.	If there was less than one stars I would go lower, the trains are 10 minutes late every single day there is no point keeping it at a certain time just for the 1/10 chance that it might arrive on time because it barely does. At least make it for the time it usually comes so I don't have to wait ages at a station. Update your times to something more realistic or get yourselves together and provide at least a tiny bit better service it would save me and a lot of other people a lot of troubles.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2017-08-11T10:56:31Z	Unacceptable refund policy	Monday 19 June. Asked to leave train at Bristol as it had developed a fault (I can only deduce this as two guys in orange jump suits came and went as we stood in temperatures over 30C). Got on next train which was so full many passengers were left behind. Friday morning 23 June. Train to Bristol Parkway 20 minutes late so GWR terminated it at Temple Meads. Asked to change trains again. Next train ran late late too. Friday afternoon 23 June. Asked to leave train at Bristol as it had developed a fault (no men in orange jump suits this time but the rolling stock is over 40 years old...) Next train heading home was the worst overcrowding I have ever experienced in 45 years of train travel. No apology. No explanation. No refund due as I was just under 1 hour late at my destination. So, bounced off a train 3 times in one week. Over 90 minutes late and verging on heat stroke - is that OK GWR?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2017-08-11T10:56:31Z	OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE	I have to use GWR services 5 days a week. Even though the train ride between Bristol and Bath takes just over 10 minute, I rarely have the privilege of having a service on time. You will hear a LOT of 'we're sorry to announce' that they're missing train crews, that they have signaling problems, and the list goes on. The journey between Bristol and Bath costs an extortionate £7.60, which turns out to be the most expensive short train journey in the U.K. And if you want to get a refund, hope that you're train was delayed by more than an hour, which happens quite regularly anyway. At least I've got time on my hands to review their atrocious service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	5
2017-08-11T10:56:31Z	A truly incompetent company	I went to Reading Station yesterday to renew my Network railcard. I was met with astonishing rudeness. The lady who served me said she's a fast server, and if I had gone to another window she could have served 3 customers in the time she took with me, instead of doing nothing while I filled out the form. It took me 2 minutes to complete. I was going to book tickets as well, but I was so put off I didn't. Unbelievable rudeness.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Phoned web support to get a refund on one of them and gentleman said that in order of getting a refund I will have to print out the form and send it to them by post to get a possible refund in a month time. The other option there is to get a voucher emailed! (not sent by post) to you with the ticket price credited for future use on GWR. I'm going away for 3 weeks and won't have a possibility of printing anything so I've been forced in to choosing a voucher option.GWR plays dirty, unacceptable refund game that nowadays shouldn't take place. I wood like to get a refund the same easy way I've given them my money especially when it was purely their fault.Have used their services for over 5 years and now will be saying my goodbyes.

I was late for a train and asked to be let through the barrier so I could board it and buy a ticket from the conductor or at the barrier at the other end. Staff would not let me and seemed to enjoy telling me it as my fault due to my own poor time keeping - really rude and inflexible, when they could so easily have used their discretion rather than obstinately sticking to the rules. Poor time keeping on my part maybe but they also had only 50% of ticket machines/windows open so equally poor management on their part at 8.00 am so peak time. Really poor service when they could have so easily been helpful.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

I guess the lack of competition allow them to afford such bad services. App glitch double booking could only be solved by sending unused tickets by mail (by mail, for crying out loud!) and wait 30 days (30 days!!!) to get a refund. I've made a mistake using the over complicated website and ended up losing my ticket (cheaper than paying the £10 fee). Come to the 21st Century GWR!

I told that I can not amend it even if I pay the amend fee, however the conditions of m-ticket clearly state they can be amended.   After a number of unpleasant phone calls and emails and web chat on their Facebook page, I am now told that to change my electronic ticket (m-ticket) I have to complete a paper form, send in the post and apply for a refund, and then I have to re-book my m-tickets.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2

2017-05-28T08:05:05Z	Worst Customer Service in the UK??	Without doubt the worst Customer Services I have ever had to deal with. All I am trying to do it legitimately claim for two journeys that I'd bought tickets for that I could not make due to train/track problems meaning all trains to my destination were cancelled. It's very easy to buy a ticket but near impossible to claim a refund. I have spent hours on call to GWR over many months now (more than six months and counting).You wait 30mins for them to answer the call, and they always tell you its going to get sorted/in the post until you next phone back in 2-3 weeks as nothign has happened - only to find out there was a problem with the last person you spoke to not doing something right. It's just appalling.On 21st Oct I was told the letter has been written and will be in the post once paired with the cheques. Still now, 14th Dec they are telling me the same thing. Right now I don't believe I'll ever see my money, and I believe GWR deliberately carry out these constant delay tactics so that people who are owed money just give up. Trying to contact them via Facebook is a farce, they seem to have no access to any information whatsoever and just tell you to call the main telephone number. If anyone has any idea how to progress refund claims with GWR with any success I'd be very keen to hear.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

GWR is the only railway company in whole of Europe to do this (as I travel a lot within EU) and the old pathetic ticketing staff is such a disgrace., as my name was printed on the ticket clearly there is no way one should be able to steal and use them., I'm so annoyed that they got me to buy another one at the cost of 37 quid., shame on you GWR	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

The web page promoting it says:""Now’s the perfect time to get adventurous. For big savings of up to 60% off, book until 2 December 2016, for travel up to 16 December 2016.""Unable to book on line I try their web chat - but it 's offline at 3pm on a weekday?

I then find a new form for refunds which I complete (with a scan for the ticket). I then get an email telling me to send the ticket to the address at the top of the email (guess what - no address). So I email them back and get told that due to  an increase in customer contacts they may take THREE WEEKS to get back to me. So I try their number. After 30 minutes I give up.

2017-05-28T08:05:05Z	Website a disgrace and GWR a cynical rip-off outfit.	I don't usually have a problem using most websites, but the GWR booking platform is a real disgrace and their customer service is appalling. And I think I know why.My first attempt to book a return from Bath to Paddington ended in disaster when I found, after paying the money, I had booked an over-60's ticket when I am not over-60. When I had finished shouting and swearing at myself and had had a sit-down, I went back to review what I had done. Yes, it does tell you what the ticket is, but in the confusing jumble of tables, numbers and boxes that is GWR's excuse for a customer-friendly web site, it's easy to miss. Unfortunately this was only the start of my misery.My early efforts to get my ticket cancelled and refunded were prematurely ended by a 20-minute wait on hold to speak to someone by phone before I finally gave up and resorted to their so-called 'web chat' service. Here I was told that I would need to be emailed a refund form that I would have to complete and post back to them before they would consider my case and decide whether or not to give me my money back. Absolutely incredible!As it turned out this 'web chat' was never concluded because the woman dealing with me apparently went home, went off for a smoke or maybe just died at her desk because the 'chat' suddenly ended mid-stream with her leaving the line open and me waiting for her to type something. Like the phone call earlier, after a long wait I eventually gave up and went away. Which is what I suspect they wish all their 'problem' customers would get on and do.So with little option I had another go at the web chat and at last, this time I got some semblance of a result. The man went to my booking, cancelled the ticket and posted on the page a printable form that I could use to apply for my refund. I would still need to post it back to them however - with the cancelled tickets when they arrived - just in case I was trying to rip them off in some way I suppose, I mean, you can't be too careful these days can you?A few days later I summoned up the strength to have another go at booking that elusive ticket. After all, it's not like a have a choice, do I GWR..? I was careful this time, making sure I had the correct dates and times and above all, double checking I had the right ticket for my age group...So imagine my surprise when, after paying the now vastly inflated fare having got within a week or so of my travel date, the confirmation came through telling me departure was an HOUR LATER than what I thought I had booked! I was astonished. I couldn't believe my eyes. This time though I stayed calm. I found my transaction and carefully clicked on 'amend booking' which took me back to the booking page. So far so good. It was at this point I discovered what I think is one of the most blatant and cynical rip-offs I've ever experienced from what can still just about be considered a 'public service company'. I was charged an additional £10.00, plus an £8.00 'administration fee' to change a booking a had made minutes before. I still can't get over it!So now, for my return ticket from Bath to London, off-peak, booked nearly two weeks ahead, I am paying a grand total of £96.00. And I'm still awaiting the refund (should they decide to give it to me) on the original booking. Nice one, GWR.I said at the beginning I think I knew why GWR's online booking platform and customer service is so appalling. I'd suggest that if every wrong booking runs up a charge of at least £10.00 to correct and if a substantial number of those bookings are made due to a website that is difficult to read, understand and operate, then there will always be a reluctance by any outfit driven by profit and that measures 'public service' by cost alone, to make any substantial changes, except perhaps to raise their prices even further of course.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2017-05-28T08:05:05Z	Once again I have wasted ages trying to use their website but its still useless	I tried to order tickets online again today. Was unable to pay for my journey but the website simply says theres a problem with the info I have entered. I repeated the process several times believing the problem was mine. After many attempts on different cards, I tried web chat. Waited about 20 minutes for someone to respond. They simply said there was a problem with their website. I asked why they didn't say so on the website. Their answer was they didn't know why! More hopeless attitudes from a company that has changed its name but is still offering dire or no service on this monopoly line.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2017-05-28T08:05:05Z	Reasonable adjustments whenever they are needed	I agree that if I have to do just an occasional rail journey that it is helpful to book assistance, but I am no less busy or prone to need to travel at short notice as someone able- bodied. It is not helpful when trying to book seats that there is no facility there for disabled customers to indicate their needs. Every time, I have been given seats in the carriages at the far end of the train,too far for me to walk and I would have no access to the buffet service there. I need to book a seat next to the aisle,near a toilet and the buffet in the middle of the train. I have to have a seat,as I cannot stand for more than a couple of minutes and am in pain even then. There is nowhere to put a fold up rollator. It would not fit in the luggage rack or between the seats and I had to lift it onto the table, as there was nowhere else for it. I need to use a wheelchair almost all of the time now and the arrangements are prehistoric. If there are changes of platform, I need help and also must have a seat on the next train, yet no-one ascertains whether anyone has issues before allowing a fee-for-all to commence. Any move to reduce staffing on trains and platforms will make it worse of disabled people. Staff need to be told that even if assistance has not been booked, they should provide reasonable adjustments without moaning as they could often have done what was necessary by the time they have finished complaining.They need to ask what they can do to help,as everyone's needs will be different. Disabled people are not the problem. It is the barriers presented by practical issues and attitudes which must be changed to facilitate disabled people being able to live as independently as possible.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2016-10-06T14:49:20Z	Lack of customer services	I have just complained about how I was not helped as a disabled person.  I missed a train on platform 3, then had to go back to platform 9.  I had not booked help or assistance.  Lifts being used by staff to ferry trolleys and other equipment prevents use by the general public,  I can't manage escalators.  The Gatwick train, I had been given wrong connections for,  I agree this is pretty hopeless.I'm suggesting that disabled travellers are told, help is not available if not booked.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2016-10-06T14:49:20Z	Hopeless customer service	"I sent an email to GWR saying that I wasn't happy with being stuck standing up for an hour on a train from London to Reading after they had cancelled other services. They didn't bother to reply, so I sent a second email telling them I thought that they were very rude to not even acknowledge my comments. I then received a very quick response - I wonder if this was because I had mentioned posting on social media - with an explanation of why the trains were cancelled, which would have been the response I was expecting. They also offered vouchers as an apology for not having responded, which I did not expect, but thought was a nice gesture, so I replied with thanks and with my address details.That's the last I heard from them; now 33 days ago. I did send a second email 12 days ago in case I had mistakenly emailed an unmonitored account - despite being sure I hadn't, but wanting to give them benefit of the doubt - but have been ignored again.Presumably GWR only care to talk to you if they think you might tell other people how disdainful their customer ""service"" is. I won't bother travelling with them again; I pity the poor people who are stuck with them for regular transport, it seems they would rather spend huge amounts on rebranding themselves than actually fixing the issues that made their reputation so poor in the first place. When I decided I would post on here, I wasn't even slightly surprised to see the other reviews people have given."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2016-10-06T14:49:20Z	Absolutely appalling	Was charged a full fee for not having my railcard even though I had the email confirming that I had the railcard and was able to prove my ID.  Inspector and the twitter helpline referred me to the terms and conditions.  No element of discretion whatsoever, absolutely appalling way of running a company.  My perfect train journey with my two children following a lovely holiday was instantly ruined. I was charged more than 100 pounds.  I still can't believe it.  Profit and money making versus real people, that's what it is	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1
2016-10-06T14:49:20Z	Their level of customer service ranks along side the worst I have ever received.	Belive it or not I have just finished hanging on the phone for 1 hour 16 Mins waiting for someone to answer (Web Sales Support - 0345 7000 125). Time now 20:48Finally my phone ran out of charge and disconnected.I consider this to be a level of customer service that ranks along side the worst I have ever received.Why advertise a HELP line when no one answers it???	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2
2016-10-06T14:49:20Z	If you are going to use GWR to get from Reading to Gatwick Beware !	I use First Great Western from time to time to travel from Gatwick to Oxford via Reading. Like all services, it has its problems, but this lot has a pretty disgraceful way of getting round the running of late trains.If the train to Reading is late, they will turn it back at Redhill.  They may tell customers at Gatwick, they may not.  So if you're at Gatwick, check the true situation if the service doesn't appear on the destination board.  Arrivals and Departures at Redhill using nationalrail.com should give you what you need.  You can get a local train to Redhill to link up, irritating though that is.It's rather worse the other way round.  If the train to Gatwick is late, they will turn it back at Redhill and bounce customers, often with heavy luggage, unceremoniously off the train.  To get to Gatwick they then have to negotiate two sets of steep steps in Redhill station or try their luck with the lifts, which don't always work, and then wait for a commuter train from London on another platform to complete the journey,  The First GWR driver will tell you there are plenty of trains.   No, but there are some.This is a toy town service with loads of level crossings and other things to go wrong along the route.   And, to put it bluntly, this lot don't give a damn about their airport customers.  Find another route if you can.  Otherwise, make sure you can carry your luggage up and down stairs and add an extra forty minutes to your planned travel time - just in case a pig runs across the line.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	2

2020-11-09T18:29:53Z	Took 8 months to not get a refund	Applied for a refund on tickets back in March due to COVID-19. I sent in all the needed documents and waited. After no correspondence for a few months, I contacted Support. In September, I finally got a response asking for more information. I sent the information in, waited til October to be told the refund couldn’t be issued. I had to give a passive aggressive reply for Support to tell me they would look into it further. Waited til November and emailed in to see if anything had happened. They replied the refund couldn’t be issued because the tickets for the journey was in March.I gave them some slack (probably too much which is my fault for being sympathetic to a travel company during a pandemic where you’re not supposed to travel) seeing as it’s a busy time in the pandemic situation, and I’m not happy that they didn’t tell me the tickets weren’t refundable when I originally applied for a refund and that they then sent me emails implying they were going to issue me one.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2020-11-09T18:29:53Z	Refusing to modernise	So somebody is abroad and is travelling to the UK and wants to buy a ticket with this lot. For delivery they give you the option to either post it to a UK address or pick it up from a machine/ticket office at the station. Great. So now you pay by Paypal and because you're not in the UK you can't have it delivered at your UK address so you choose the station pickup option. Excellent. Now we are in the coronavirus pandemic and things change from one day to the next so it turns out you can't come into the UK on the selected date. So now you're looking to change that ticket to a different date. Now the only option to have it delivered is via a UK address which creates a conundrum only they know how you can solve. So you have a relative who can receive the ticket to their UK address and then post it to you so you pick that option. But they don't send you the full amended ticket, they send you an excess ticket which is not valid unless you have the original ticket. Nobody is going to tell you that you have to pick up the original ticket from the machine to use the excess ticket. And if you used Paypal as the method to pay then you cannot pick it up from a machine because there is no provision for that, you have to go to the ticket office and get it from there. But not all stations have ticket offices and they're not open 24/7, not even at the airports!Why on earth can't they just issue an e-ticket for your devices countless other companies do and they use this archaic and convoluted system only they know. Perhaps they can't be bothered.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

2020-11-09T18:29:53Z	Extremely rude GWR staff member at Bristol Temple Meads	Quite alarmed by the rudeness and contempt that is clearly permissible by GWR. Myself and my partner were travelling from Cornwall and needed to make a change at Bristol Temple Meads. Having been on various trains over the course of 5 hours we were understandably rather tired by the time we arrived. We regularly travel so we are used to making changes and we are also familiar with Bristol Temple Meads. I arrived roughly in the area where we needed to catch our next train but was momentarily disoriented and looked towards my partner who was slightly behind me to confirm which platform we needed to be on. I was stood near, but not too close to a train on the opposite platform bound for London Paddington. Suddenly a tall GWR staff member wearing a black mask with short black hair launched himself at me and shouted “where are you going?” In a tone which suggested I am totally devoid of a brain. He was glaring at me so I took a pause as I couldn’t work out why I was being spoken to in this way and for a moment wasn’t even sure whether he was a member of staff owing to his complete lack of professionalism. He continued, again in a mocking tone, “this train will leave in a minute so you need to know where you’re going”, my partner then confirmed where we were headed to which the GWR member of staff pointed at platform 13 where the 2.39pm service to Great Malvern from BTM (the train we required, 23rd October) was arriving into the platform. “That one” he spat, towards my partner. A much more helpful member of staff almost seemed to intervene at this point as if also dumbstruck by his colleague’s rudeness and confirmed what we had just been told. As we went to board the train I remarked “slightly rude, but thank you” as I was disgusted at the way we had been treated. His anger came out of nowhere and we had not sought any help so his presence was a surprise. We would of been grateful for his assistance had it not been brought forward with abrasiveness and contempt. I was hardly holding up the other train as I was nowhere near it and after all, if confused passengers miss their train, that’s their fault, so there was no need for any of his attitude. The situation was compounded by the fact that as our train left the platform and began on its journey we turned to the passenger window and clocked the same member of staff on the platform waving at the carriage and blowing a kiss! Perhaps this was jokingly intended for the driver of the train but as it came so soon after our minor altercation it seemed too much of a coincidence. The action also seemed to be deliberately sarcastic and however you cut it, it’s rather strange behaviour! He clearly has little time for members of the public and is deeply dissatisfied in his role and he certainly should be nowhere near customers. He seemed to be fizzing with anger and attitude so I can only assume we were not the only recipients of his particular brand of charm this afternoon.  I would add I have never had a problem with train staff before and think they do a marvellous job, often under immense pressure. Coming from a customer service background myself I can appreciate that totally. However, I hope this complaint is taken seriously and the member of staff in question (whom, unfortunately I am not able to name) is given thorough customer service training and guidance on how to maintain his composure and control his anger.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

On other occasions I have been cat called by staff on the way out of the station and charged extra for adult tickets despite at the time being a child because I didn't have ID (who does at 15?)Other than the staff being rude the trains are often packed due to lack of carriages at peak times yet passangers are still expected to pay the full fare.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

On other occasions I have been cat called by staff on the way out of the station and charged extra for adult tickets despite at the time being a child because I didn't have ID (who does at 15?)Other than the staff being rude the trains are often packed due to lack of carriages at peak times yet passangers are still expected to pay the full fare.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	1

Forget phoning, filling in the online form or emailing, the only way to get any kind of assistance is via their Twitter feed, though I must say Celia on their Twitter team was a marvel.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.gwr.com	3
2020-11-07T00:27:03Z	Many thanks Grand Central Customer Service	"A huge thanks to ""Julie"" ? in customer services who resolved a ticketing  re-booking for a 1st class booking I made with GC about a month earlier .Her professionalism outshone LNER  and as a result  will consider  GC  first for travel. I've been using both GC & LNER for round trips from Kings X to Sunderland but prefer to use GC as their onboard staff are far superior to that of LNER,adding that Sunderland is a better station in spite of taking more than 30 mins more to do this journey to Kings X. Trains may not be as fast as the  LNER Azuma's but seats  are more comfortable & staff more visible in this corvid19 crisis,unlike LNER who are nowhere to be seen with people not getting tickets or  Rail Cards checked."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	5
2020-11-07T00:27:03Z	Refunds	Bought two advanced singles to York from London to visit family I have not seen in 10 months. Local lockdowns re-applied to my area so I could not travel. GCR would not refund the tickets unless I specifically had contracted COVID. They then stated I can only change the tickets for later dates at a cost and I would have to buy the new tickets first before refunding. Please tell me GCR staff, when should I change the travel dates to? When the Pandemic is over? For if you know that I am sure more than one aggrieved customer would be keen to know.... bring back virgin rail. Shambolic.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1

They only paid me back £88.00 instead of £96.00, it should be fully refund!!

2020-11-07T00:27:03Z	Inconsiderate!	Ref B-GRANDCNTRL-OTQ03CP5IAdvance Ticket is non-refundable. I requested to cancel my train ticket that was booked  on 25 Jul 2020 for a return journey on 28 Sep 2020 - 30 Sep 2020. Unfortunately, I overlooked the terms and conditions. Therefore, I have no choice but to go for it rather than losing my money for nothing which was £65.30.I explained my situation to the three customer service representatives I talked to but no one listen instead they all go with their spiel and I ended helpless and hopeless. I told them that the reason of my travel was for an appointment with US Embassy in London but the US Embassy cancelled it due to covid-19 situation in London. Although, these representatives I spoked with offered me option where I have to book another ticket which is a peak-off ticket (more expensive ticket) before they will refund my original purchased ticket. However, I mentioned to these people that I do not know yet the specific date because it really depends on US Embassy when they will be opened to the public again.Hopefully, this company has flexible terms and conditions especially today with our current situation (Covid-19 Pandemic).Lesson Learned:1. Read the terms and conditions from start to end regardless of how long it is. 2. I will not make anymore business with Grand Central Rail after this experience. Good part:I am a type of person who planned in advance, in fairness with Grand Central Rail, when I looked for train tickets last July 2020 for September 2020, only their company has an advance schedule trip to London. Which is very convenient for me to plan ahead.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1
2020-11-07T00:27:03Z	It’s the way forward.....	As a family with a daughter living in London we often use the Grand Central service from Brighouse or Mirfield  to London KX.In the main it is very helpful for us to have a direct train from these little towns despite services available being minimal.We have at time experienced specific trains being cancelled on this route - with alternative arrangements offered - so I always make a point of checking in advance. We also make sure we have a seat reservation due to disability..... able passengers taking the priority seats  generally will not surrender the seat.On Sunday morning 3 August 8am mid   pandemic,  the train wasn’t at full capacity. My daughter and partner were travelling  into London from Mirfield. I queried via Twitter if the service would still be running. I got a very polite and prompt response from somebody with the initials LA confirming it would.I explained in my query that this journey was part of a much bigger trip i.e. they were then travelling to Heathrow and flying to Sweden to start the next phase of their  life. I simply thanked them for being a part of this journeyThe train arrived and we helped them on with their luggage. They went to their reserved seats and were greeted with a free upgrade to 1st Class with free drinks and food in response to my Tweet. I see a lot of reviews on here are very negative but with respect to this journey the customer service we received was 100%.. We all felt this was an absolutely wonderful gesture.In this worrying time my daughter has  now arrived  in Sweden.  Once again I thank Grand Central for being part of her journey.On a side note I will add whenever possible we have purchased a seat reservation number directly through the GC website particularly for journeys departing from London KX .When passengers book open return tickets  from London a rail company probably won’t  know which service those passengers might choose to return on leading to excess passengers.I would welcome an increase in GC services with the possibility of extra carriages . It’s the way forwards-... or backwards depending on the way you are facing 😃.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	5

2020-11-07T00:27:03Z	Disgusting Service.	Train from Kings Cross to Sunderland was cancelled at short notice, contacted Grand Central who told us to use earlier train. No seats available so had to stand until York. Took almost an hour to get into then leave the station due to signal problems (apparently). It was then announced that the train would be terminating at Hartlepool where a bus would take us to Sunderland. Absolutely disgusting service and shocking value for money, approximately £130 return. In future we will use GNR service from Newcastle when travelling to London.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1

Arrived at station to find train cancelled, had to go to another train station to catch LNER service lost seat reservation and travel assist freaking out my autistic son arrived at London an hour later than planned, had to drag my son almost kicking and screaming through the underground system at break neck speed to make our pre booked (very expensive) slot. By the time we got there my son was so upset he didn't even enjoy the exhibition, whole day was marred by the initial experience. We were so disappointed we returned back to Kings Cross early to find they had cancelled the return leg aswell. Again lost our allocated seating and travel assist. Managed to sweet talk the LNER staff to put us on an earlier train as the alternate transport arranged by GCR would have seen us arrive back to the wrong station at around midnight with no connection back to where our car was. The GCR staff were apathetic as was customer services and my sons longed for Christmas treat was ruined. Will we ever use them again ---- NO ------ take my advise use LNER they couldn't have been anymore helpful.P.s tried to get a partial refund for train being cancelled, received email from GCR saying because LNER service was better than theirs and more efficient we didn’t qualify for refund but as a gesture of good will gave us 25% off next purchase........ cheeky ba**ards.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1

2020-11-07T00:27:03Z	Bought a first class train ticket	Bought a first class train ticket, in advance, from London KX to York. Arrived at the platform 15 minutes early, only to find all seats and standing room had been taken. People with expensive tickets, me included, left on the platform as the train departed. Tough pill to swallow, made even more difficult by the fact it was a 4 carriage train....at Christmas! Refund policy difficult with lots of loopholes. My sense is, it’s all a scam. Double or triple book the train, take customer money and then let them work out how to get to their destination. Disgraceful and saddens me. Perhaps the government should intervene with higher costs, tougher regulation and forcing a more open complaints/reimbursement procedure.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1

Then when you speak to customer service you go our to a call centre where they are rude, unhelpful and struggle with communication.I will never book via Grand Central and recommend anyone goes to Trainline to book which is the opposite of the Grand Central farce.This could easily be a 5 star review but get your website and customer service sorted out Grand Central.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1

Maybe not the operators fault, but the service is popular because they offer cheaper seats than for example LNER. The trains typically only have 5 carriages so will always be busy anyway. This journey was rammed so no chance of being able to get to reserved seats.  Going out the guard refused to acknowledge our tickets were valid (they were). He demanded we buy new tickets at a cost of £254.00.He wouldn't back down but was proved wrong. He refused to apologise which there was no excuse for.

You can imagine the panic that set in.TOTAL NIGHTMARE and when I spoke to 'Customer Services' ,I use that term very loosely,they couldn't find my booking (but happily kept the £470 I'd paid) then told me they'd refund me (which incidentally wouldn't reach my account for at least 3-5days) but I would have to buy another set of tickets costing me over £500!The whole scenario caused me at least 1 hour of phone calls during work time and untold stress at what was already a painfully difficult time for me having just buried my father on the Monday.

I definitely WOULD NEVER use GRAND CENTRAL again.There's absolutely no communication regarding seating. Something that may have even been nice might have been to provide a tea or coffee to all the standing commuters as an absolute bare minimum. but NOTHING.You know who's bought a ticket so you know the numbers, so get your number of carriages right!I've never heard of this happening on any other form of transport.

2019-08-27T16:23:44Z	Overcrowding - check ticket carefully!	If you are booking a train on Grand Central through a third party, e.g. Trainline, please check your ticket as there’s a good chance a seat will not have been reserved for you. GC’s policy is to reserve seats for anytime/off peak tickets if they are requested, until 24 hours before departure. Now I will explain why this information is crucial. As a fairly regular user of GC trains, I can safely affirm that every single train I have ever boarded after 4pm is overcrowded. There are simply not enough carriages to serve the customer demand of these trains and nothing appears to have been changed to alleviate this. Unreserved seating areas are few and far between, and on occasion you’ll be lucky to get a fold-down seat in the vestibule. Each time I’ve travelled on GC I have overhead people who have similar complaints. I suppose from a business perspective it’s great - save yourself a few bob by loading customers like cattle into your trains instead of increasing the carriages. But if one thing’s for sure, I now avoid GC like the plague. Give me LNER any day. I’ll pay extra. I’d probably even walk from Northallerton to York to avoid it.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	2

There are now waste rubbish bins, I’ve had to find one in the WC.Then finally the reason I’ve knocked 3 stars off, for each grumble I have, apart from the overhead parcel shelf, there is no luggage storage on ground level.  Currently nobody is occupying the Wheelchair space, so everybody has stored their large suitcases there...approximately 10 at last count. PS, I hope my back/hips done give me jip on my trip to London. 2nd PS, my husband has just gone down to sort out suitcases which are now so many they are obstructing the aisle.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	2

2019-08-27T16:23:44Z	Horrendous	I have just got off my first - and last - Grand Central train and was absolutely appalled. The train was shockingly overbooked, with many passengers, including children, standing all the way from York, filling the corridors and even sitting in the aisles. Every single toilet on the train was dirty and blocked, meaning I could not use the toilet for the entire 3 hour journey. The train was so dirty I tried to use the sink to wash my hands but no soap. The temperature on the train was dangerously hot. I’m assuming the air con was broken, as a surly member of staff distributed small bottles of free water to everyone, though he did not at any point apologise or provide an explanation for the excessive temperature. As soon as I left the train I found a guard and told him that the service was appalling. He agreed but told me there was nothing staff could do and to tweet a complaint. I will never use this rail company again and would advise others to avoid at all costs.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1

Due to travel on the 3rd of June from Sunderland to London only to be informed via tannoy that the service had been cancelled. Alternative travel arrangements had to be made to get a train from Newcastle (Tyne and Wear metro which broke down resulting in £20 taxi cost).As the grand central was cancelled, the alternative LNER train was extremely busy resulting in standing for the entire journey. I arrived in London 45 minutes late. My complaint is more about the way customer service handles the situation rather than the journey. I was informed no reduction on my ticket or compensation was available because they had made alternative arrangements. I feel I was put under a great deal of stress and pressure, arriving at London extremely fatigued due to grand central, and still having to pay the full price for the experience. One of the worst customer service experiences ever.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1

2019-08-27T16:23:44Z	Terrible customer service	Terrible customer service. I'm shocked at how such people can be employed with such poor customer service skills. To elaborate, my train was cancelled this morning (which I booked through Trainline). I wasn't informed of the cancellation and only realised when I checked my app prior to gettitn ready to leave.Due to me booking the tickets through Trainline I won't blame Grand Central for not informing me of the cancellation and of the replacement shuttle service (which I also wasn't informed about). I'm just giving details to explain the next point.Rang the customer service line to see whether it would be possible to board the next train. The customer assistant on the phone was really unhelpful, didn't offer any help in the slightest. Enquired about whether it was possible to reserve a seat in which he said there wasn't really any reservations (just priority). Then asked if we could sit any where, in which he said that some seats are reserved (contradicting himself). So asked what should we do bearing in mind I reserved due to my wife and baby travelling, didn't offer no help and just simply gave us the option of go and see where you can sit or book another ticket (bearing in mind they cancelled on us).To conclude, the reviews already speak for how terrible this companies customer service is and what seems best is to not waste my money on this company.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1

However, they have now lost my customer loyalty and I could not recommend the service anymore.The train on 3 June was cancelled, and rather than Grand Central arranging with LNER for its adv booked tickets to be able to be used on the 8.31 LNER service to London, presumably to save itself a few quid it sends us to Sheffield on a Cross Country train and then the 10.29 East Midlands from Sheffield, so rather than 30 mins late, makes us over 2h late (due to arrive at St Pancras at 12.36pm), assuming the rest of the journey goes okay... Poor show from Grand Central, and looks like it puts its £s ahead of the customer when things go wrong.

2019-05-22T16:23:49Z	Like so many here an appalling 1st…	"Like so many here an appalling 1st Class service from Grand Central. Booked through Trainline two first class tickets from York to Kings Cross. Got on no seats reserved and none available.The dirty rotten trick they play is that when you think you're booking a specific train, they sneakily actually sell you an Open Return. If like us, you haven't used them before (and I never will again) you have no idea this will happen to you when you climb on board the train expecting a seat and find you don't have one. Now, this expectation in my case was exacerbated, because also at the same time through trainline, I booked 1st class Edinburgh to York returns. It cost me almost double to do this because I wanted to travel with my mate from York, in seats next to each other on that part of the return journey.On the Edinburgh to York legs (which I travelled on my own) I got first class seat reservations automatically. Like a mug I assumed the same with Grand Central.On the way down, we at least got seats in standard class. On the way back we stood in the packed gaps between carriages. On arrival at Kings Cross, we decided to go to customer services. There were other Service reps from the other lines there but, guess what no Grand Central Reps. They called the Grand Rep guy and he turned up shortly. We asked if we could reserve seats for the return tomorrow and he said it wasn't possible. I said I've never in my life booked a first class ticket on a train and not got a reserved seat. I said this stuff goes on all the time with you lot doesn't it. He said yes. I said you lot are a ""shower"". He said ""Yes"". To be honest ( and he was so refreshingly) we absolutely cracked up with laughter. Ripped off but what a hoot, still chuckling now at him.

Upon arriving at the ""correct"" platform we were told that our problem was definitely not grand centrals problem and we were on our own.. when I requested the name and job title of the staff member in question she covered her name badge with a scarf told me to ""f@#k off"" and ran for the staff only area.. after going to the information desk and getting very little help it became apparent that the rude lady from the platform called the transport police and had made a false report that I had assaulted her..

2019-05-22T16:23:49Z	Dreadful - A complete shambles of a company	Let me start by saying when you book Grand Central (if you’ve used them before) you kind of expect it’s not going to be as good as other providers, and we knew to expect a lower quality of journey than you’d get on Virgin. And if was simply another case of a tatty & dated train, Wi-Fi and plug sockets that don’t work, disgusting toilets and general 3rd class service I wouldn’t mind - as having used them a few times ive realises that’s the standard (on a good day) on Grand Gentral. So the above being best case scenario you can expect, here’s what my most recent (and last ever) 1st Class Grand Central journey panned out... So with it being my wife’s birthday I decided we’d upgrade and go 1st Class on a recent trip to London. It’s a 4hour journey so we booked well in advance. Our train was 12:18pm and we thought we’d beat the rush by going to the platform for 12pm. On stepping onto the train we sharp realised lots of people would be standing this journey as Grand Central has cancelled and therefore merged 2 together - that’s right they massively over-sold the amount of tickets versus the amount of seats. Being first class and having booked early we thought we’d be fine though, but this wasn’t the case - we ended up standing the entire journey for 4 hours, alongside LOTS of other frustrated passengers also standing in the aisles or sitting on the floor including elderly and pregnant passengers. The only way I can describe one of the staff members who spoke to us like absolute dirt was snotty and rude. The only thing he did to communicate the situation to the passengers was make an announcement that this wasn’t his fault, so don’t waste your time moaning to him about it and anyone who their frustration out on the staff (not that anyone was) would be ejected from the train. Guessing this must happen a lot, so they were preparing themselves ahead of the barrage of unhappy travellers. On the plus side, having 4 hours to kill standing around with nothing else to do (and nothing to eat because the food carriage was bare - probably because there was 2x the passengers that it can cater for) allowed me plenty of time to write this review. Whilst Grand Central’s idea of 1st Class is standing outside a toilet for 4hours on a over-subscribed train, it’s certainly not what I expect when paying several hundred pounds for tickets - and the worst part of all is neither Grand Central or The Trainline will accept responsibility. Grand Central are saying The Trainline should refund, as they only refund if bought directly off their website, and The Trainline are saying it’s Grand Central who should refund as its an onboard issue. It’s awesome how both companies say eachother should refund - yet neither of them actually will. True shirking at its best.Whoever is running this shambles of a service (Sean English?) should be ashamed of themselves; although truth be told the people at the top probably travel Virgin and will be oblivious to it. So in summary, don’t book with Trainline as they’ll take no responsibility and you’ll get no refund when things go wrong - and don’t book with Grand Central as they’re too unreliable and don’t care either.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1

However, you would think that in difficult circumstances they would at the very least provide excellent customer service. Well, take it from me - they don't. I received an email offer for a discounted ticket. In fact I received 2 emails, each with a different offer number, within minutes of each other. Neither of them took me to anywhere I could get my discount. I complained and was told that as their system/site was working properly all they could do was send me another discount voucher. I pointed out that my travel date had now passed and a voucher would be of no use as I had no plans in the foreseeable future to travel to London. Their attitude, frankly, was a sort of polite could not care less. In June I wrote a letter of complaint to Grand Central's MD Mr McClean. Did I get a reply, or any kind of acknowledgement? Of course not. The MD of a business sets standards by example and it is obvious that his standards are on the same level as those of his staff. It is actually convenient for me to use Grand Central but they have sold there last ticket to me.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1

Now seating is crammed and not much different from normal class. Coffee used to be good quality, now is some lukewarm, water like coffee infusion that I wouldn't drink. Electric plugs did not work in the whole carriage, which makes it a bit difficult on a long journey, especially when you haven't made sure you fully charged your battery, since you were expecting plugs, as advertised.If you don't prebook seat (booking a seat is not allowed when booking on virgin or any other website) expect all seats to be reserved and to be paying for a posh area to stand. Get your act together Grand Central. Your services is not what your customers expect	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1
2018-08-13T13:10:17Z	Keeps getting worse!	Trains cancelled almost every day lately with no prior notification on the Grand Central website. It’s no good leaving it until passengers arrive at the station when they know for hours beforehand that they do not physically have trains available to run the scheduled services. Directing passengers to a twitter page for updates is not good enough, not everyone uses social media! Services that are running are so hot that it is dangerous for staff and passengers. Seats physically wet from the amount of sweat. Grand Central seem to be giving up so your passengers will too!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1
2018-08-13T13:10:17Z	Train cancelled!	Shambolic absolutely desgracful when a service that run services every 30 minutes cancels 3 or 4 services it doesn’t have such mass impact on the service uses but when a service like grand central who runs 4 or 5 services a day from London to the north cancel 70 percent of there trains it leaves there service users with hours of delays hours of travelling to unrealisable destinations to get follow on conscripts that are there on delayed it’s shambolic like the majority of English railways.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1
2018-08-13T13:10:17Z	Shambolic	No air con again today on the hottest day of the year to date! Grand Central obviously aren’t bothered about customer service as Carriage C air con hasn’t been working for months.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1
2018-08-13T13:10:17Z	London to Sunderland AirCon Issue	So, Grand Central are one of the operators who only offer the bare minimum of compensation required under the law. But even trying to prize your refund for a cancelled/3 hour delayed journey is painful.So far I've filled in their online form, submitted it, with no confirmation receipt, waited the 10 working days, emailed to follow up the request, received no confirmation of receipt, waited another 10 working days, and still nothing.This is to compensate a Grand Central train cancelled due to air con broken where I was rerouted - via another London terminal, via a different city, arriving home 3 hours later than scheduled. They were too cheap to allow us to travel on the LNER/VTEC services leaving for my destination every 30 or so minutes, so I had to wait an extra hour and go the long way round. And yet no refund?Seriously, it's a false economy to travel GC. Spend the extra £10 and travel with a proper operator.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1
2018-08-13T13:10:17Z	Compensation claims a joke	GRAND CENTRAL TRAINS NO LONGER CARES FOR PASSENGERS!!!Carriage temperatures are dangerously high, paticularly for elderly, babies and pets. That's six journeys I've made in two weeks with no air conditioning. I have noted that the air conditioning is always working in first class !!!What has happened to Grand Central Trains?They are clearly having senior management problems. Train crews are brilliant, but seem regularly short staffed.I would try LNER.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1
2018-08-13T13:10:17Z	GRAND CENTRAL TRAINS VERY POOR	Travelled on a standard class return ticket from Sunderland to Kings Cross, first train to Kings Cross was freezing cold, but return journey back to Sunderland was the train from hell! Air con was not working for the entire journey (during a heatwave!!), train was full to capacity and everyone was complaining. Train staff gave us a very small, warm bottle of water for an over 3 hour journey! There were elderly people and children on board who were clearly effected by the heat, one parent had to strip her baby down to her nappy to try and cool her down! Staff were at a loss to deal with the numerous complaints from everyone and it appeared this wasn't an isolated incident as one regular user of Grand Central I spoke to who travels for work said this had happened several times when he has used Grand Central. I will never use their trains again. Please think carefully before booking with them!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1
2018-08-13T13:10:17Z	Worst journey ever!	Have travelled on Grand Central for a few years now and in the past it was a joy to use.The decline through 2018 has been staggering. They must hold the record now for most cancelled or dleayed trains. Same again this morning. A points failure this time. So not ther fault.Buffet car closed. Is there fault.Last Thursdys train 7.30pm from Kings Cross cancelled. Most definitely their fault.Even a ticket inspector on the LNER service we jumped on said even they are now sick of Grand Central.The onboard staff are fine, and deserve credit, but please take great care if you are relying on Grand Central to get you anywhere for a certain time. Dont say you havent been warned.The service is shoddy beyond belief. I now go to the station expecting to look at the board and see it cancelled. Luckily for me my company pay ffor my tickets so I dont suffer financially, just as well.I would have sued them by now.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1
2018-08-13T13:10:17Z	Have travelled on Grand Central for a…	"They’ve taken over some of the trains on the east coast route that Virgin Trains used to operate. What a shocking decline in the standard of service provided, compared to Virgin and LNER who still operate some of the trains on this route. Over booked, far shorter trains, shabby, dirty trains, yet same price. When travelling on this route `i will never travel with ""Grand"" Central again.Appalling!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1
2018-08-13T13:10:17Z	"Awful service from ""Grand"" Central Rail."	Omg on a train right now from kings cross to York absolutely packed out with people from other cancelled trains and broken air conditioning in 28 searing heat, everyone's reserved seating go e to pot! Buffet cart closed, no one offering free water to elderly or children, I'm never travelling with this train service again! Disgusting,  staff that I've seen which is 1 so far, don't want to know, very rude horrible experience	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1
2018-08-13T13:10:17Z	Grand central rail, don't do it!!!	Travel from London to York return. Cheap but no seats! My daughter is 12 years old and suffers from anxiety issues. On the way from London to York she and her elder sister had to sit on the floor by the toilet. t’s really a running joke that train companies sell tickets but don’t reserve seats for its customers. Let’s be clear about this : Rail companies are making profits from hard working people who are forced to stand hour after hour on packed trains . If you cannot provide the seats don’t sell the tickets. Finally I do not wish to hear the tiresome ill judged ideological arguments about ‘consumer choice’ ; they are too weak to be posted here. Grand Central need to get this sorted out immediately !	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1
2018-08-13T13:10:17Z	No seats !!	Travelled from London to Thirsk. First class tickets AND WE STOOD ALL THE WAY THERE! £150 return and NO SEATS! Scandalous. The aircon didn't work and the stewards were surly and did not supply drinks and snacks as they are supposed to... instead eating the snacks themselves! A passenger eventually found cool drinks and distributed them. The train home terminated at York. The worst railway journey I've ever undertaken - and one of the most expensive. We are awaiting a decision on refund/compensation. Meanwhile, avoid like the plague!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	2
2018-08-13T13:10:17Z	Travelled from London to Thirsk	They never have enough seats for their weekend, bank holiday or Christmas services, I have had to sit on the floor of these trains more than I've sat on a seat. They seem to reluctant to add on extra carriages in peak times but but more than happy to bump up fares. These trains get packed up constantly with other train cancellations passengers. Every time I travel on these services I think if there was a fire we would have no chance the corridors are dangerously rammed with passengers. Jeremy Corbyn used the wrong company to make an example of poor Northern connections he should have travelled on a Grand Central train then he would have had no choice but to sit on the floor.It costs me more to visit my parents in Hartlepool than it does for a flight to another country where I'm guaranteed a seat.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1
2018-08-13T13:10:17Z	Dangerously full trains	Tonight First class Virgin ticket from York to Amberley West Sussex leaving at the scheduled time of 7:32pm.  Virgin train delayed by 30 minutes so catching my last connecting train at Victoria to Amberley is now extremely unlikely. Grand Central guard Andrea and her platform manager refused to use discretion in these exceptional circumstances and allow Virgin ticket holders onto their 7:11pm departing train. Andrea commented ‘ we don’t get any revenue by letting you on our train’.This lack of cooperation between train companies and the lack of intelligent discretion by staff is just one of many reasons why there should be just one national train service. Shame on Grand Central.A Virgin staff member commented that they normally do allow Grand Central customers on their trains in this type of situation. He described some Grand Central staff as ‘jobsworths’.Grand Central train departed York to Kings Cross ontime with no intermediate stops and a number of empty seats.Arrived Kings Cross 33 minutes late. Arrived home West Sussex 40 minutes later than expected. Virgin paid £266 for a black cab to take me from Kings Cross to home in West Sussex, all because Grand Central would not let me take up an empty seat on a non stopping train from York to Kings Cross. What utter wastage and stupidity!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1
2018-08-13T13:10:17Z	Grand Central’s lack of cooperation and intelligent use of discretion.	First class traveller sometimes using Virgin for once a week return trip to London. Always cheaper than Virgin East Coast.Comfortable seats and spacious cabins. Brilliant staff. Just the odd grumpy one, you know who you are, but hey we all have to learn.Variable cleanliness of floors, windows and toilets.Only snacks provided in first class - Virgin offer meals during the week. Remember you are paying more. Vibrating noisy diesel engines under each carriage.  Virgin have  locomotive engines at the front and back of the trains giving a much smoother quieter ride.Toilets never have both soap and water. Yuk. Surely a H&S violation? How do the catering staff wash their hands??No first class lounges.  Cheaper tickets remember?The rolling stock on Grand Central is very, very old but with refurbished interiors. Virgin East Coast is much newer and  about to be replaced with tbe state of the art Azuma trains. Usually one thing goes wrong on every journey! So. You pays your money and you takes your choice.  Hope this iis balanced and helpful.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1

Every time I am forced to take one of the trains there is something calamitously wrong. Examples are:No toilets No hot drinks - hot water not workingNo foodNo power in carriages Carriages over bookedEvery time it something of the above or a combination. Shockingly poor service from Un-Grand Central. Avoid!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	2
2018-08-13T13:10:17Z	Shockingly poor	Regularly use grand central trains and would recommend for services to Yorkshire and North East. Refurbished trains are an improvement. Customer service usually good though sometimes struggles when things go wrong. Would have been 4 stars if they had kept the HSTs  and got rid of the class 180 trains with the noisy diesel engines under the floor rather than other way around.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1

Can't wash hands.Terrible.Not at all first class!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1
2018-02-16T21:45:43Z	Not a pleasant experience	I booked this ticket online but knew nothing about Grand Central. Despite being 'inter city' to York the train itself  seemed unfit for the purpose.   It lurched a lot around a lot on corners and efen on steaight stretches and I wondered if it was a refitted commuter train not suitable for higher speeds.   There was a smell of faeces as you entered ther train which went away after a while but came back after about an hour.  Quite unpleasant... The carriage was noisy as well as the engines (still diesel in 2017??).  It sounded a bit like an old 1970s bus. The ticket was not cheap, almost double the  return leg which turns out was with Virgin.  If I see a ticket for Grand Central in the future Ill probably avoid it.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	2
2018-02-16T21:45:43Z	Luxurious, Direct Travel!!	I have always travelled with Grand Central to London from my base in West Yorkshire. Firstly, because I can travel direct - without having to change trains. Secondly, the trains are clean and well-taken care of. The seats are comfortable too. Free wifi on the train is an additional bonus!I also like the online booking system through their website. Very easy to navigate, and all I have to do is to bring the email confirmation, instead of having to collect tickets from the machine at the train stations.Their prices are reasonable too, if booked well in advance. I have always had positive experience while travelling with them and can highly recommend  the company to others travelling the routes which they cover.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	5

2018-02-16T21:45:43Z	Terible customer service & date protection breach	On a recent journey a member of there staff asked us to complete a survey as part of that they asked to see the ticket to make a note of it.  I'm positive that by accident they didn't give the return ticket back. No big problem we had the reservation email seat number and could prove we bought it.  We even offered to go with a conductor the seat we had bought with the email confirming this was my seat with proof of my identity but we got told no. we got told it was are fault for loosing the ticket.  When I contacted them after through web support we got told we lost the ticket so it was are fault they just wouldn't listen to make matters worse one of the replies was not for me it was for another customer with there details and complaints reference on dealing with there issue.   I will never use them again I don't mind the lady loosing the ticket mistakes happen but when something goes wrong its how they deal with it that matters.  Shocking service shocking attitude and its obvious we didn't matter	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.grandcentralrail.com	1

Also the vibration coming from the line is terrible which means the seat table is almost useless. This is clearly an issue with the train as the pendolino trains are very smooth on the same line. Will be avoiding these trains in future.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

2020-11-11T13:38:08Z	Often problems	I often use their train service from Huddersfield to Manchester Airport and there is often a problem of one sort or another. The worst I have experienced was for a flight and I arrived at Huddersfield station to be greeted by the message all trains to Manchester Airport are cancelled. You can imagine how that feels if you have a flight. The next worst was a train to the airport that stopped in central Manchester and they announced it would not be going to the airport, which caused everyone to panic. They put on a coach to the airport but I didn't want to risk that being too slow, so I had to take a taxi. They wouldn't reimburse the taxi fare.I sometimes use their app. When I tried to use it recently it wouldn't let me log in. I tried resetting the password and even deleting the app and reinstalling but neither helped. I contacted their online chat but they were unable to help. I asked that the problem be forwarded to their technical department but they said they were unable to do that. I emailed their customer support who took about four days to reply. They said they couldn't help as I should have emailed web support not customer support. They could have forwarded my email to web support themselves.I recently booked a first class seat from Manchester Airport to York. The price was about double the normal price - I see they are taking advantage of people wanting to socially distance. Normally in first class they offer an included drink and biscuit - they did not do that. I'm sure their excuse is it's because of covid. Nobody came to check my ticket or came to check the first class customers. At least the train was on time and the carriage was clean.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	2
2020-11-11T13:38:08Z	Eventful journey	No masks worn by several passengers,no tickets checked,no sign of any staff on board.Had to move to another carriage when a fierce  argument broke out between members of a group who were not wearing masks or socially distancing despite loads of empty seats on the train.This was my first train trip since lockdown,and apart from the above incident,have given 3 stars due to punctuality,availability of seats enabling social distancing,and cleanliness of the train.Just a shame that TP is not checking whether ALL passengers are conforming to present guidelines and safeguarding ALL their passengers.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	3

This friday's train disappeared off the timetable (discovered by random search of network rail). The 'alternative' offered lost half a day of am already short visit and there was no seat booking system on their 'alternative' route. Its far too late to get an affordable ticket with another train operator. They simply blame the cancellation on covid but they have done NOTHING to make the situation easier to navigate for the customer. If past experience is anything to go by we'll still be waiting for a refund at Halloween	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

2020-04-19T18:21:46Z	TPExpress need to put customers ‘first’	TPExpress have the most unhelpful approach to Advance ticket refunds in the current circumstances. This includes the need to apply for a refund prior to the scheduled departure of the first booked train, an online application and printing off a form to post to them. Other TOCs have a much simpler and customer friendly attitude. including emailing a picture of the unused tickets cut in half. What about older customers who don’t have access to email/ internet, can’t return unused tickets to a ticket office, or customers without a printer.

Their website does not work and after sending daily emails informing them of the same and after numerous telephone calls, contacting them on Twitter and Whats App I have got absolutely nowhere with them. I was told to use a different web browser. I tried four of them - Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer and Firefox with the same result - their website doesn't work!!!! They Have £69.25 of my money and my tickets, which they don't refund you for if purchased in advance online. I also visited my local train station as TPE web support advised but I couldn't amend my tickets there either. So be warned don't buy your tickets online. Only purchase from the station and help to save jobs. By the way if you telephone them be prepared for a long wait, at least twenty minutes, what a joke this company is. I have saved all of the emails and tweets that I have sent to TPE, so if their management want proof of this ongoing saga please feel free to contact me before I take this further. I expect many people will be wanting to amend their tickets due to the current restrictions with travel in Europe, and I hope you have more success than me. Good luck you will certainly need some. You have been warned.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

2020-04-19T18:21:46Z	Worst train ride in my life!!!!!!! >:(	We had booked tickets, so we got on the train and got in our seats. An announcement was suddenly made that the seat numbers had been changed into a random order. A random man was sat in our seats. Bloody fuming. So the conductors solution was to sit us in the worst seats in the house... right next to the bloody toilets. Dont book with this is train company. Its absolutely awful!!!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1
2020-04-19T18:21:46Z	Absolute Chaos	Delayed on the way to Edinburgh. Even worse on way home. Absolute chaos. Seat reservations in wrong seats. No direction as to where they were. We had to move from our actual seats as someone else had the numbers on the paper reservations. When we eventually found our seat and the people in them refused to move, the conductor's solution was to sit us on fold down seats directly outside the toilet after being quite rude to us and a number of other passengers. Awful.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

A cold but brief wait.VERY DISAPPOINTED though that NONE of these THREE Transpennine trains were able to offer us a hot drink. We were told by one member of staff that this was due to a fault on BOTH drinks trolleys ...  and then by a second member of staff that this was due to the train being new and the hot water had not yet been connected!!

2020-04-19T18:21:46Z	Refusing to own their mistakes. Appalled.	"I've had nothing but terrible experience with TP Express. Like another review I read here, I nearly missed a funeral which I changed my flight for. I'd just been on a flight for 17 hours non-stop and they decided to cancel all of their train services as their staff wanted to all have the Christmas period off due to the implementation of new trains and making up overtime worked.I asked at the station if there was a bus (would have taken over twice as long and would have missed the funeral) and I got an unclear grunt. I booked a taxi home at a cost of £79 on top of my train fare. I asked TP express if they would refund me the £79, as it was their mistake.Over 1 MONTH later, I received a response that said ""you cannot claim your taxi fare, you can claim your train fare back, but as the window of 28 days has now passed, you can't"". So even though my query was 2 days after the journey and THEY took so long to reply that I missed out, I'm paying double for THEIR mistakes. I've never come across such a disorganised shambles of a company. They said they were ""too busy to respond"", hardly surprising when there are so many other similar experiences to mine.Next time, I'll take a longer journey, just to avoid giving this shambles of a company anymore of my money, which they seem to like keeping.Please do yourself a favour and avoid."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

Seriously, hire some smarter people or invest some money into improving the service, just do something. I hope even some of this feedback actually reaches decision makers at Transpennine. Also, having a customer support Twitter account that’s posting lighthearted gifs is really not funny for someone who’s been waiting for 3 hours.

I booked a seat intentionally because I had surgery five days ago and knew I wouldn’t be able to stand for over three hours (especially on an overcrowded train). They changed a planned 8 carriage train into a 4 carriage train so my seat didn’t exist. No help AT ALL from the conductor. I went and stood in 1st class as that was the only part of the train you could even stand in. I was told to move (not sure where I was supposed to go as there really wasn’t anywhere else to go and moving at all involved climbing over heaps of people). I agreed to move if they agreed to bring me to my allocated seat so they really had no option but to finally leave me alone and I am still standing. The thing is, the last time I travelled between Manchester and Edinburgh the exact same thing happened but both ways!!! I paid £85.30 to stand on a crowded train!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

2020-02-10T14:27:33Z	Worst of all the train franchises	I live in Manchester and travel a lot for my job. Transpennine are the worst of all the franchises and that takes some doing. Although recently they even excelled themselves over a delay repay. Since it has been introduced I have used it a number of times with various other franchises and had no issues. You are delayed, you claim, they accept responsibility, you get sent a Cheque. End of. Not with trans pennine though. I was delayed nearly two hours on a journey from Manchester to Leeds. Dead straightforward, £30 ticket should be refunded. Filled in the claim, get response “sorry claim rejected you were only delayed six minutes”. Ok, just an oversight, filled in the appeal, explained again, listed all the trains I took and which one was delayed, surely now someone would read it properly and refund it. Email comes through, appeal failed, you were only delayed six minutes. Now I have had to write a complaint as they won’t take calls on the issue and am approaching the time at which they can respond and, guess what, still nothing. They are constantly late or cancelled, service on platforms is rude and abrupt, cramped carriages all the time. What a joke of a franchise I hope they go under they deserve it.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

The noise pollution around the rail track when these ‘new’ trains are operating is beyond a joke. Anyone living within a few hundred metres of the Leeds to York line are now having to endure this nuisance. The old trains, even the dreaded Pacers, were very quiet in comparison. These engines need to be properly engineered and new silencers fitted before they’re allowed to operate. Another example of TPE shooting themselves in the foot by introducing new rolling stock that hasn’t been properly engineered.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

The train as expected was very busy, no luggage space and poor passengers standing in the aisles with their large and heavy luggage for most of the journey. This was unnecessary because some passengers had coats and small bags on spare seats and hogged luggage space with small light bags. I do not know if tpe first class staff are responsible for monitoring use of available seats and luggage spaces, but surely a  polite announcement could have been made over the intercom about this. Two staff members, one a trainee stood chatting in first class for the entire journey from Leeds and didn't even offer water or bother to speak to  passengers. I have always found the lovely staff to be the redeeming feature of the often poor service from transpennine but sorry on this occasion staff indifference at an all time high.

Staff gave the time of the next service and I noted it down. Meanwhile on the outward journey, the train was cancelled at short notice. Rang TPE again and got NO help, just the repeated sentence ""you can get the next available service"". But does that mean the next TPE service, or are other operators accepting tickets? Staff couldn't say ""as you booked through trainline"". Eventually got assistance from staff at Leeds station. Then on the way home, guess what? our tickets were not valid on the train I had been told to catch, got told to leave train at Alnmouth, freezing cold winter night and a station with no facilities. The guard on that train, a Cross Country service, did say TPE has an agreement with LNER to honour tickets. SO why did TPE staff never mention this???

There was an  incident involving 5 teenage boys. There were several elements to the  incident, but the mature  conductor, was extremely calm , assertive  and consistent dealing with what could have been an even worse situation.  He made sure that all of the other passengers  were safe .....What a GEM of a man. Transport police met the group on the platform. I know lots of people are having delayed and bad journeys., but we felt it was note worthy to commend a fantastic member of staff.....who displayed a master class in dealing with a potentially dangerous and very intimidating situation...

So we head off to York and as clearly predicted, the train is cancelled at York to wait for the next one which “is just behind”. So all passengers walk across to the new platform just to hear an announcement that as there is no train crew available in Leeds, the next train will be delayed. It came 50 minutes later -  when TPE platform rep in York were asked the question as to why a train would be cancelled when the train coming up behind did not have any crew, the answer was that they would not have known. Please get rid of this franchise - too much time lost and an apathy that it is just acceptable- it’s not!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

These cancellations have a real impact on our lives guys.Honestly don't know what to do here - do I need to build in an extra hour buffer to every journey these days??  Seems that way!And I really feel for the poor travelers whose morning trains to the airport keep getting delayed or cancelled - how much time should they be building in as buffer for their journey??As an aside, you must be losing a fortune in revenue through DelayRepay - invest now, get more contingency staff onboard ASAP!Sort it out PLEASE.Very grumpy (sorry for the shouting but this is crazy).

2019-12-21T12:46:13Z	Zero customer care	"The wife and I had tickets from Leeds to Scarborough for a weekend away for her birthday.  At Leeds the train we were supposed to be on repeatedly kept pushing back on the announcement boards.  3 mins delay8 mins delay17 mins delayThen it disappeared from the board altogether.  It then re-appeared, several times; and with continuing delays.  Eventually after 40 mins we boarded the train - YAY...!!!  Or so we thought.Around 3 mins before pulling int York the train driver announces that the train will terminate at York and apologised.  He then went on to say to see the Station Master who may get us a taxi to our onward destination.  (THIS WAS CLEARLY TO APPEASE THE PASSENGERS).We proceeded with the other passengers to the centre of the train station where there were already literally dozens (possibly 80+) passengers that had been waiting for the 11:47am but this had also been cancelled.  (Our train was the 12:21 from Leeds that was due in Scarborough at 13:39 - It was now around 13:25!!!)  The representative from TPE was clearly under pressure from the sheer volume of passengers.  His response was that there were 2 x buses on the way, one passenger asked what time they would arrive and is there a designated seat for the hordes of passengers that had now built up since the 11:47.  His response was that it was unlikely there would be enough seats and had no idea where to board the bus or what time they would arrive.  Needless to say the passengers were visibly upset at this.  The man from TPE then said ""I don't have to put up with you lot"" and then briskly walked off...!!That was it, trying to get another TPE representative was not going to happen.  We waited around a further 30 mins and no-one showed, not one person...!!  Then another TPE representative with a beard (I point out his appearance as he refused to supply his name, his manager or any other contact details).  To be fair to him, he tried to diffuse a now extremely disgruntled group of passengers after his colleague basically told everyone they were on their own..!!  However, regardless he had no answers.  His story was that he didn't know if buses had been requested, had no idea if there were to be any further trains but advised probably all had been cancelled and had no answers for how passengers to to get to their destination.  He too then became uncomfortable and quickly walked off.That my friends is how TPE treat their customers.  I wouldn't mind but you could actually still pay to book a ticket for a train that didn't exist.I was left with an upset wife, 2 x large bags and a group of passengers not knowing what to do.  There was no further trains in sight, the train driver had suggested they may get us a taxi so that is what I did.  It cost £80 from York to Scarborough, the meter was beyond £80 but the cabbie felt for us and capped it at £80.I will never use TPE again unless I have absolutely no alternative.BUYER BEWARE:  You pay you money and you definitely take your chance with no guarantee that you will get to where you want to be."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1
2019-12-21T12:46:13Z	Absolutely shocking service from…	"Absolutely shocking service from TPExpress over the last six months. Have to use them regularly as I work in York and live in Thirsk. Massively overpriced for the terrible service they provide, I can't remember the last time a train in the evening was not delayed, often being nearly 30minutes delayed! Of course you only get compensation if it is over 30minutes, which would be a fine if it wasn't such a regular occurrence. Then when the train is delayed by over 30minutes and you submit a compensation claim, they try their hardest not to reimburse you, claiming you have boarded other trains when you in fact haven't. Train this morning was cancelled, had to be in York for 7:30 so had no choice but to purchase another ticket at £18 for a single! No point getting pre-booked tickets at the cheaper prices because they are SO unreliable! Not even guaranteed a seat for nearly £20 a ticket for a 20minute journey and prices are set to rise AGAIN in January. Absolutely bloody shocking! Asked if I could get refunded for my advance ticket as the next TPExpress train would get me in to York too late, that's if it showed up on time, or if it even showed up at all, staff were uninterested and told me ""you'll have to do it online"", offered no website or advice. No wonder everyone is driving everywhere, all I can say is the sooner I pass my driving test the better! Screw the environment.

For my Christmas holidays I decided to travel on a bus because I cannot trust them. The only reson people choose transpennine express is because it is the only option here in Yorkshire. This company makes life harder to other passengers of other companies. Because of all these cancellations we have to use trains of other companies so most of the time people that have purchased ticket to travel with Northern are left over because the train is full of transpennine express passengers. I will not be surprised if in the near future we hear that this company goes bankrupt etc.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

No information provided other than ohh a bus will take you which appeared on the boards. Adds a an extra hour to the original journey. Lovely day in Edinburgh, back to Waverley for our return journey, train to Carlisle cancelled.....  no staff to tell us what was happening. A virgin trains member of staff told us to go onto the street outside where buses are and a member of TP staff would be their to advise, literally nobody to be seen. We walked to the buses ourself to ask the drivers what on earth was going on, then we did TP’s job by informing other travellers where themBusses were travelling to. Transpennine express what a pile of rubbish. Wish I could give zero stars. Won’t be using again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1
2019-12-21T12:46:13Z	Couldn't Care Less About Passengers	Monday December 2nd all trains to Manchester Piccadilly from Huddersfield around 7 a.m. were cancelled or severely delayed. Fortunately for me the 06:51 to Liverpool was slightly late but this only calls at Manchester Victoria. I decided to get this train and walk to Piccadilly to get my connection (a 20 minute walk). On Tuesday 3rd it was the Liverpool train that was cancelled but the 07:00 to Piccadilly was shown as on time until around 06:58. Suddenly this train showed as Delayed with no estimated time. Then an empty TP Express train was dumped on our platform (by one of their drivers) completely blocking our train from coming in. At around 7:20 the dumped train was still blocking access to the platform and the 07:00 train was now showing as terminating at Stalybridge - which is of no use to 99% of the passenger at Huddersfield who will be trying to get to Manchester. By this time I had missed my connection so I gave up and went home. Luckily I can work from home but many can't. Because my onward journey was on a separate ticket with a different company (in order to save money) I have to pay an admin fee to cancel that ticket so don't get a full refund. I have asked TPExpress to compensate me for this charge but I bet they won't. This is one example and most days several trains are severely delayed or cancelled. The ones that do run are dangerously overcrowded. We were promised a full fleet of new trains (with more capacity) by the end of 2018. On year later we have a couple of the new trains and that is all. At least they don't run Pacer cattle trucks but that is the only good thing I can say about Trans Pennine. Furthermore, the word Express in the name is surely a breach a Trade Description rules.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

Wanted to order via a Cashback site but the train times I wanted ie the cheapest were not available even though they were online via TP website.  Nor were they available via Trainline so forced to go to TP website.  Then, having gone through whole booking again online it said password not recognised.  OK, requested new password, Received email with a link to reset but was then asked to input a passcode from the email.  Guess what, there was no passcode!  So I have to set up another account, using another email and then go through the whole booking process again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

I've been stuck waiting at the station for hours at a time because  apparently they don't have any drivers. They have been frequently cancelling 5,6,7 trains in a day. There is only one train provider to some of these towns and even though it annoys me that I cant get home or get to work on time, these towns are suffering too because it is damaging tourism in the area.Avoid wherever possible.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

Over the last few days alone I've had trains cancelled on me three times and numerous late running. This isn't a service at all. How are we supposed to function when we have one train an hour and it's like a lottery as to wether it runs or not. It's impossible to make plans. Because of missed connections from York to London, my last two journeys made my arrival over two hours late.

I am late for placement almost daily because of the continual delays and cancellations through Manchester Victoria often due to a ‘shortage of train crew’ seriously???? Your company buys a shiny fancy new fleet of Nova trains and you don’t even use them properly - how about getting more organised before buying new fancy trains and sort yourselves out. Today im say here at Manchester Victoria with FOUR TRAINS IN A ROW INDEFINITELY DELAYED AND MULTIPLE OTHERS CANCELLED for various ridiculous reasons including few shortages and signalling problems - the same reasons I hear almost every day.Even Your  three carriage class 185s are woefully inappropriate for rush hour services - three carriages at peak time - people stood up from Liverpool to Manchester.

2019-12-02T19:14:53Z	Abhorrent company	Not much more I can add here.  TPE never, ever fail to disappoint.  That clunky 3 car diesel bus that passes for a train is apparently sufficient to connect several of the north's largest cities. It's a joke that isn't funny anymore. Just put some more carriages on!! As for their much vaunted new Nova trains, well I did see one in a siding at Huddersfield.

2019-12-02T19:14:53Z	Feels like you are on an old bus	Out of 5 journeys during the week at peek time, mainline Lancaster to Edinburgh, only one was anywhere near on time. Various excuses such as “the train was late leaving the depot” or “driver didn’t turn up” don’t really cut the mustard. Also you’ll be lucky if you get decent heating (or in fact any at all) as apparently the conductors aren’t trusted with controlling this. All in all, don’t bother, try to use Virgin instead if you can.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1
2019-12-02T19:14:53Z	Never on time, no heating	Worst Trainline ever. Forever cancelling trains. When they do run usually overcrowded and late. Travelling to Edinburgh. Everything going well until they decide to terminate the train at Carlisle so train can go back to Manchester. We wait for a train to arrive from Edinburgh which would terminate there and head back to Edinburgh instead of heading to Manchester. What was the point?

2019-12-02T19:14:53Z	Worst Trainline ever	TP Express are going from bad to worse. 2 trains to/from Edinburgh last 2 weeks. Both massively overbooked - despite assurances of a booked seat - standing room only. One of these journeys must have had at least 150 people standing. Sardines is an understatement.2 x complaints to TPE. Their response - ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Annoyingly there were even spare seats in 1st class, and other seats not available due to a bike.At least have the courtesy to advise passengers the train is overbooked - rather than issue a seat reservation ticket and then withdraw those on the train! They have no consideration towards their passengers.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1
2019-11-15T17:58:51Z	0 STARS!	0 STARS!I am currently, finally, sitting (Not in my booked seat) on a Transpennine Express service. It was delayed by 17 minutes, which resulted in the train resembling a tin of sardines. The train station displayed the carriage lay out back to front resulting in me standing at the wrong end of the platform and not being able to push past everyone to my seat. I have a seriously bad back, and have been in agony waiting to get a seat. Elderly people have been forced to struggle and stand without anything to hold onto. I can't express how angry I am!I don't expect a refund, work paid for my ticket. I don't even think I expect Transpennine Express to contact me if the other reviews are anything to go off. What I would like to see is Transpennine Express making a change to their services! I hate to think anyone else was made to suffer in pain like who knows how many people have today.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

I tried to book 4 tickets. tried 4 times, kept asking for credit card but nowhere to input it. eachtime i went back or refreshe the screen, price incresed, £10 a ticket each time. I called them. I initially was told Im booking too early, then if that is the case, why let me get to payment prompt. then i spoke  to a 2nd person. Clueless. when i finally got a verbal price it was £350 from £106. I was told to try again in 2 hours as sytem refereshes.

The new driver came along but once he reached the front of the train he turned and went back towards the entrance of York station. Next the monitor changed to 'delayed'. Ten minutes later I saw the driver running back with what smelt like a bacon sandwich in his hand. What a joke! Why he couldn't go to one of the two food stands on the same platform as the train, or get a snack from first class, i do not know.  It's completely disrespectful. I cannot wait until I do not need to use them.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

2019-10-19T19:54:48Z	Feeling like lingering	I had a train ticket for my partner to Manchester Airport on 26th August, which was cancelled. My partner took the next train, however, he chose to take a taxi from nearer train station to the airport because of his flight. Then, I completed a form, sent the scanned versions of the tickets to their address, because my partner had to take them to abroad. I only requested the ticket of the cancelled train, not the taxı fee. We are emailing each other since the beginning of Sept 2019, I provided my address, the receipt of the tickets, reference number etc... whatever they wanted. Then, they concluded that it is an abandoned journey and they cant pay. I explained that I wanted the refund for a cancelled train. I was informed that my claim passed through web support team. I contacted web support team. And they do not know anything about my claim! So, there is no outcome so far since 4th Sept, I am going on to contact to different customer relations advisors and web supporters etc. The first time I had difficulties to get refund in England.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1
2019-10-19T19:54:48Z	this company as the worst customer care…	this company as the worst customer care and service i have ever come across :( all i wanted was for them  to say sorry and acknowledge their lack of customer care! this was the letter i wrote  to them :On Wednesday 28-8-19 my train which was due to leave at 14:18 from Leeds Station  to Manchester Airport at was cancelled.On account of suffering from severe back problems following two operations i am unable to stand for any long periods of time (no more than 15mins) because of risk of severe pain which my physiotherapist says may hinder my recovery. After standing on the platform for some time I asked 2 members of Leeds station staff if my seat reservation would carry over onto the next timetabled train to Manchester Airport, to which they replied that it would not. I informed them about my condition to which they replied that they would ensure I had access to priority seating on next service.  When the next train to Manchester arrived the platform crew informed the train crew that I need to be seated. I told to get on the train and I would be found a seat once the train was underway.However on boarding the train it was so crowded that I was pushed to the opposite door from where I was unable to move. Throughout the journey I imagined that the train crew needed time to sort me out a seat and that as passengers were leaving the train at the intervening stations staff would come to find me. As even more people got onto the train I found myself pressed even harder against the doors. I never saw a member of the train staff throughout my journey and was in considerable discomfort until we arrived at Manchester Piccadilly.If I ever travel again with Transpennine should I be forced to provide documented proof from my doctors that I have a severe back condition? Perhaps if I did then possibly your staff  would take my health consideration seriously and provide me with sufficient care and support.  Unfortunately I have been left feeling very angry and frustrated at the pain and stress Transpennine has caused me due to a distinct lack of customer care.this was the first reply :  Dear Johnathan DunnThank you for getting in touch with Transpennine Express we would love to get your feedback about your most recent contact with Hervin Peart.

2019-08-29T16:26:02Z	I travel return from leeds to durham…	I travel return from leeds to durham weekly and can honestly say l avoid tpe when possible. In my experience if the train lve booked has not cancelled the one before or after has meaning there is never enough seats. On my last journey l had to stand between leeds and york as my reserved seat was taken by a young traveller who had to use the service due to the cancellation of his train. The guard refused to get involved. I understand that the passenger has as much right as l to a seat but l am 65 and arthritic and feel a seat should have been provided. It says an awful lot for the younger able passengers who either looked on smugly or tried to look as they had no idea that someone was in dire need of a seat. Spare seats on 1st class were not made available as it was apparently not fair to those who had paid  A higher price. For me to avail my self of the seat l was told to pay full price without the benefit of an advance fare. And still lose the cost of my original ticket. 1st class seats should be given when tps cancel trains for those unable to find a seat in standard. I am of the opinion that trains are cancelled when they have not met sufficient bookings to save costs. Cancellation on this route appears to occur regularly most days. I intend to avoid avoid from now on	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

2019-08-29T16:26:02Z	DANGEROUS TRAIN - my worst ever train journey	On the second of May 2019 I got on a Transpennine Express train to go from Penrith to Manchester Airport. The train got all the way to within walking distance of the Airport Station, and I was then involved in a disturbing incident.Right above where I was sitting there was an extremely loud noise, sparks were flying into the carriage and there was a smell of smoke.This incident shocked and disturbed me and the train had broken down.Straight away the staff on the train started doing their best to deal with it, and discussed with passengers, myself included, what could be done. They stated that an evacuation of the train could possibly be done and we could walk to the station because we were so close. They also said that a diesel train could possibly come and get us. Either of these two options done fairly quickly would have been acceptable to me, but what followed was ridiculous.There followed approximately two hours of messing about by the company while we were stuck on the train, which was a potential fire hazard, and not allowed to get off.Eventually after about two hours we were given an announcement and told a train would be coming from the station to get us. The announcer stated that he was extremely unhappy that this had not been arranged for us much earlier and he'd be putting in a report to the company saying so.By the time the train got to us and we were transferred and the train got to the station we were approximately 2 hours 40 minutes late.While all this was going on, one by one passengers were ringing Airlines, friends and family to say they'd missed their flights.We were effectively held prisoner on a dangerous train. We were told if anybody got off they'd be arrested.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

2019-07-05T16:57:27Z	Most unreliable trainline	"Here's what I love about TP:a) The Manchester to Liverpool service is often late and watch out for how late it is. If it approaches 30 mins (the point at which compensation is due) they'll cancel it, which then forces you onto a slow Northern service, which just falls short of making you 30 mins late. Are they in league with one another? Even when it is on time, it often dawdles as it approaches Liverpool Lime St.b) The same 3 excuses are trotted out.""Fire at a property by the track"" ""Fault on the train"" ""Trespassers on the line""They only run once an hour but a mere whiff of smoke near the lineside can knock out, not just one, but the following TP train as well. c) Seat reservations at peak times/rush hour. Why? Every day I see empty reserved seats and people standing in the doorway. When boarding the train there is an awful lot of bustling as all the commuters pile on and don't know whether they can sit down or not.I never thought I'd say this but I actually prefer Northern!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

When I bought it there weren't any specific information about that and is written that is valid just in different station. In the info box is not written in any area that is valid just on the northern line. I've spent lot of money, also for replace your mistake because I didn't receive on time the ticket and now is not valid and i've to buy other ticket for your mistake!!!!!I called them 3 times, and they are just transfer my call from one department to another!!!!!Also my season ticket arrived late, and the delivery was guarantee!!!!

2019-07-05T16:57:27Z	Worst company in UK!!!!	Manchester to Liverpool is quite possibly the most unreliable service I have ever had the misfortune to take. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE if you need to get anywhere on time. You cannot rely on it. Quite frequently it says the train is delayed by 20 minutes and you are waiting up until that time and then it says it's cancelled and then does the same thing for the next 3 trains but only says cancelled at the last minute. Although northern trains from Piccadilly take longer it would be worth taking them because they are far more reliable and overall probably take the same amount of time.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

Food trolley chap was given ... wait for it... 4 sandwiches for the entire journey from Manchester to Edinburgh! I’m not making this up.

2019-07-05T16:57:27Z	Disgraceful level of service	Checked my booking an hour before I was meant to leave and everything was fine. When I get to the station I find out that my train is cancelled due to 'lack of drivers'. Surely if they didn't have enough staff working I could have been made aware sooner than just before my train was due to leave. Why not have enough staff to cover all the trains? Not had a good experience on previous journeys either. Often over-packed and have to stand for the whole journey and usually end up sitting on the floor. One good point however is I can often find cheap tickets if booked in advance.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

2019-03-27T07:20:41Z	What a shocking company train	What a shocking company! Please dont book your train journey with them. They really do not care about their passengers.It was my grave misfortune to travel back from Manchester with them   in March. I recently had an knee operation and was a little nervous but decided this journey should be fine as I was travelling back direct to Glasgow Central on a pre booked seat. When I got to the station they had cancelled the Glasgow Train and instead of getting one train that would get me home for 16.15. It took 3 separate trains and many changes of platforms hauling my case before I finally got the Glasgow Queen St! It was a horrible journey, in fact the first train to York was so busy i had to stand for much of the way! I finally got into Queen St 3 AND A HALF HOURS  later than I should, missing a family meal and the theatre which had been booked that night! While I was travelling back one of the guards confessed that he heard about the Glasgow train cancellation, and said the train company had jumped the gun and it really did not need to happen. But i wrote to this company, about all these points and my horrible experience and they did not even have the decency to write back. They have offered no explanation and no compensation, they really do not care about their customers. This experience is totally unacceptable and the only way answer we as the public can make is do not use,  they should not get away with this shoddy behaviour please do not use them, either use a different carrier or even the bus because if something goes badly wrong as did with me they will simply ignore you! Shame on you.Maureen..Glasgow	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1
2019-03-27T07:20:41Z	Use a proper train, like Virgin, THOSE are trains	"Add me to the long, and growing list of unhappy customers.   My daughter and one and a half year old grandson were travelling from Motherwell to Lancaster this week and as the train pulled in we noticed her Coach was missing.  She should have been coach D but it only went up to C, so we boarded C and I was there purely to help her on the train and to at least stick her bags somewhere safe, buggy, case and 2 carry bags.   We had no sooner got on the train when it was clearly obvious she wasn't getting seated in that carraige, and the aisles were too narrow for her to negotiate the buggy and her case but before I could flag anyone on the platform for a little assistance the doors started to close.   I hit the open door button but nothing, so I was forced to put my hand out and the doors bounced off my wrist and opened again.   As I stepped out to explain the issue to the guard on the platform I was snapped at by, presumably, the train guard who asked what was going on and was I getting on or what?!.   I said I wasn't travelling and both him and the platform guard told me I had to get off the train to allow it to go, I couldn't even explain that my daughter and grandson were standing at the doors with no where to go as the carriage was full and the aisles were painfully narrow and the incident just went to 100 miles per hour all of a sudden.   I was forced to put the bags onto the train at the doors and told my daughter she'd have to figure something out.Complained to Transpennine who are investigating but I know it's the last I'll hear about the incident.   Thing is, I know trains have to be on time and I know people don't want held up but if we had have known there was no carriage D we would have anticipated looking for any carriage that looked as though it had space in it and not waited for the end of the train and looking for a carriage that didn't exist!.   Rude staff and appalling boarding etiquette, I'd hate to see what would happen if a disabled person wanted to get on or someone with a lot of kids and bags.   Would not travel with them in a million years, and hell will be cold before my daughter does it again too!.UPDATE=======Did receive a response back from TransPathetic with an apology for rude staff who would be ""interviewed"" LOL, but as far as they were concerned that's the end of it, me too as well, if I have to travel I'll go by donkey, the surroundings are nicer and more enjoyable than the crammed carriages !"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1
2019-03-27T07:20:41Z	If I had the choice I wish that I never…	If I had the choice I wish that I never bought a ticket with Transpenine. Bought tickets to go to Edinburgh about a month ago, cheaper than the normal rate so I thought I was getting a bargain. Asked for my tickets to be delivered by post, they never arrived - and still haven't. I went to the ticket office at the train station I was meant to be getting my train and they said that the tickets were not valid as they didn't exist. I had a wedding to go to the next day and the train was arriving soon so I made the decision to buy another ticket at a more expensive rate. Rang Transpenine and the man was very rude the first time, and then I had to ring a couple more times to seek advice on how to get a refund. Finally, after a couple of days ringing to chase it up they said that I needed to print out a refund form and post it. I did so and posted it about 2 weeks ago, and still never head back - oh, and there's a £13 fee to even apply for the refund. Ridiculous. Never again, I would rather spend more money with a different train line.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

As a regular user of transpennie express to get to and from university I can safely say they are the worst train company I have travelled with. If I had the choice to travel with another company I would but unfortunately no other train company runs a service between York and Huddersfield. The trains never arrive on time, it seems every single train I get on of theirs has some kind of delay most which are far longer than a few minutes. The trains are always packed to their full capacity because they never put enough carriages on the trains to carry the amount of people expected to use the train, which is usually a lot. Honestly if you have the option to travel with another company I would highly recommend it.The only positive thing I can say about this company is the trains are more often than not very clean other than that, everything else is terrible.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1
2019-03-27T07:20:41Z	TERRIBLE COMPANY	Normally I use the car for business travel, but thought I’d try the train this week. Not by best decision. Travelling down to Leeds from Newcastle was fine on cross country trains. Travelling back was an absolute nightmare. I arrived at Leeds station in plenty of time for my train, noticing that the platform was looking busy. The train arrived and it was full. Everyone got on!!! We were rammed in like sardines. I had a seat booked, however it was impossible to get to it the aisle was just blocked with people. We stopped at Garforth and a few got off, but it was still packed. I stood from Leeds to Newcastle along with a train full of other customers. This is totally unacceptable, when I bought my ticket I expected to get the service I paid for. I fail to understand how a company can get away with this. I have subsequently read online reviews and this is a common occurrence. Transpenine should have their franchise revoked if they cannot provide the service they are contracted to provide. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE COMPANY.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

Unfortunately, the rest of the company leaves much to be desired. Unreliable service while the the refund team in ignores claims because of a technical issue (I bought my ticket online, paid online, received physical tickets that I retained for the 28 day period they were supposed to contact me in) and closes cases without informing the customer of what they needed to do to continue with the claim. I contacted them after the 28 day refund claim RESPONSE period (which coincidentally is the same as the 28 days you have to claim the refund anyway) had elapsed. They never wrote to me requiring any more information and instead closed the case. I rang them, and as well as the advisers not being the brightest tools in the shed, I had to give the same information repeatedly to be told ""well, you could put in a new claim if you have your ticket"" which, I didn't, because I honestly thought I wouldn't need it (I also couldn't, as 28 days had elapsed, and given their clear disinterest in giving me my money back, was another technicality to trip me up on). They certainly didn't emphasise that I would need to retain my ticket and the only distinction in claim was about how the ticket was bought i.e. at a station or by telephone opposed to their website. I will also point out the ticket being clipped or not isn't proof I didn't travel, as those trains get so packed at the time I travel they often are not checked. The first time I took this particular route, I didn't get my ticket clipped or checked anyway, and this was because it was too packed -- a common occurrence on a three carriage train that services a popular commuting route (so I'm not persuaded my paper ticket is proof of anything). TPE can now congratulate themselves for forcing someone to get a  driving license and pollute the planet even more despite their otherwise general commitment to shared (and therefore greener) travel.

2019-03-27T07:20:41Z	RUDE TRAIN GUARD 3rd Jan Doncaster-Manchester Airport 13.42pm	Rude Train Guard has closed the door right in front of my face while still standing on the platform for another good 30 seconds!!!!!! He could actually see me waving at him and begging to open the door but he didn’t , he just casually drove off pulling a face! The train was due to depart at 13.42 on 3rd of January 2018, I was at the platform at 13.41 when he closed the door in front of my face. Fair dues, I was pushing my luck but didn’t realised that the traffic to the train station is going to be horrendous due to some sort of roadworks under the tunnel in Doncaster. I could understand if he was already setting off as I wouldn’t  expect him to stop but the last passengers were still getting on the train and he closed the door to me and my sister and he could clearly see that I wanted to get on the train that was gonna take us to Manchester Airport to make it for our flight to Berlin. He was actually staring at me while I was begging him to open the door! My tickets were non refundable as they were some sort of special airport tickets but it doesn’t matter, what matters if how rude and oblivious the train guard was!!!! I have never ever came across such arrogant and ignorant human being. Well done Trans Pennine Express for employing such wonderful and helpful people. We have made it to the airport by getting a taxi (we actually arrived quicker than the train) but over my dead body will I ever use Trans Pennine Express or recommend it to anyone. I have been using it regularly on my routes to the airport but this ends now.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1
2019-03-27T07:20:41Z	Appalling service	Appalling service, I paid for a 1st class ticket and there was no trolley services so no tea coffee or even water. The fiirst guard was very understanding and told me to complain to TPE direct for a refund. The fact that I travelled all the way to Newcastle to Liverpool there was no refreshments the whole journey. When I mentioned this to the second guard that got in later in the journey he was very rude and said refreshments are complimentary and not a necessity and no explanation was given as to why no trolley service was not available. Totally disgusted. However I put a complaint in over the phone and the woman I spoke to was very helpful and said there should of been refreshments available. So I’m waiting to see what happens. TPE need to get their act together as the service is getting worse.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

2018-11-16T19:03:55Z	Awful company	Awful company, despite the glossy adverts. If their trains are late they just terminate them at the nearest stop and then turn them back round - leaving people further down the line without a service. They'll blame it on anything, but it seems more likely down to incompetence. Don't rely on this service to get you anywhere.Extra star because when they do arrive on time their trains are usually clean and comfortable and their free wifi is great too (unless you want to send photos on Whatsapp)	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	2
2018-11-16T19:03:55Z	QUICKER TO WALK..	QUICKER TO WALK..I have had to use this service a few times most recently on 11th November 2018. Yet again...delayed! No explanations are ever given. No one on customer service number could explain why. I missed my connections to London...as did half the train...so finally we are forced onto another train and stand for 200 miles. TP Express travels through some beautiful countryside though and as the trains go really slowly and make frequent stops (don't let the name Express fool you), the views at least calm you down...but if you have a choice of any other means of travel: take it. I'm a huge supporter of train travel and a frequent user for both business and leisure travel but without doubt TP Express are amongst the worst of the private rail providers.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

2018-11-16T19:03:55Z	10 years using this worsening service	I am a regular flyer and a regular user of Manchester Airport. On paper, this service is perfect - direct from Sheffield into the Airport. A few years ago it was pretty reliable, and ,although busy, rarely cramped. Now it is a joke and I will park and fly more often.Most of the other reviews sum it up - crammed in like cattle, toilets often not working, trolley service unable to get through the carriages because of the bodies, trains ill-equipped to hold airport luggage so left (necessarily) strewn all over the floor, powerless (but usually friendly) staff, difficult to contact or complain to the company...etc etc. I would add one other important thing. Recently, the company is increasingly cancelling its connection from Man Piccadilly to the airport - the last leg of the journey. They give various reasons for this, usually 'train fault'. I've been a victim of this several times, and it means you miss connections and potentially flights (I've never missed a flight but it has been very close a couple of times, through no fault of my own). I heard, though, that they do it when the train is delayed (ie regularly) so the service does not run later and later. This keeps their statistics nice and positive - just cancel the airport connection, panic and inconvenience a few passenger, but it looks good when their timekeeping is compared to the other companies.One time when this happened I enquired further with the conductor and he told me that, yes, they were late and it was necessary to keep the train punctual for later people. I argued that it was far worse to panic the airport goers but he just shrugged and said something like 'well, there's another train in 20 minutes from Manchester Picc., it's only a short delay'.That pretty much sums up the company's attitude to its clients.Finally - positive things. The views are wonderful. It should be a terrific train ride under the right circumstances. And, although one of the reviews said otherwise, I've always found the carriages pretty clean and tidy.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

2018-11-16T19:03:55Z	Absolutely terrible service	Absolutely terrible service. I travel by train quite often and can't actually remember the last time that I got a TPE train that was on time. My last return train was 30 minutes late going and cancelled coming back. And they seem to make it as difficult as possible to get a refund. I also had a seat, but like many times before, the coach that my booked seat was in wasn't actually there. Disgustingly messy too, looked like there'd been a food fight. Avoid if you can, travel by virgin or another service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

2018-11-16T19:03:55Z	Total Pathetic Excuse of a train company...	How on earth is this train company allowed to operate? Really bothers to even award one star. I bought a 1st Class ticket for my outbound journey but anyone and everyone without 1st tickets was sitting in the carriage. These people were not told to move by the guard. My original booked return train was cancelled so I had to wait 50 minutes for the next train at this point it was getting late and there was a large crowd of people finishing their night out and going home. The 1st class carriage was full of standard class passengers.AGAIN!The guard on the return leg quite clearly couldn't handle the job he was given to do and was THE RUDEST TRAIN GUARD I have ever encountered. When I asked for his name to report him he refused 3 times each time ranting and shouting for me to get off the train as it had pulled into the station (around 1 minute). I will never travel with this awful awful company again. In light of the reviews here I suggest everyone look at Northern Rail or East Midlands services who also travel to the same destinations. I have a complaint in with the company and if they do not respond I will take this further.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

2018-11-16T19:03:55Z	£ - MORALLY CORRUPT COMPANY - £	A morally corrupt private company only interested in making money for the greedy, overpaid fat cats and their precious shareholders. Expect trains to be cancelled without notice and without a valid reason. Overcrowding at peak times is a dangerous disgrace. They often cancel trains when demand does not suit income. Getting a refund is very lengthy and often problematic. The people who own this company have no morals, standards or principals, as they only think about profit and not the service they are supposed to be running for the over-charged public who have important deadlines to meet.They are the epitome of greed and selfishness without guilt. Vile.Drive, fly, walk or crawl rather than use TPE.

I called them to try to resolve it and the person I spoke to said the only way for a case to be discussed was in writing. back into the queue. I gave up 2 months later as the money I had lost wasn't worth the time it was taking to recover it. I think this is part of their intention.

2018-11-16T19:03:55Z	incompetent liars	For the past two weeks trains are consistently late or cancelled.  You are entitled to claim a refund if delayed by more than 30 minutes, but the team handling these claims are only interested in inventing reasons for denying claims.  The most common excuse is that you should have travelled with another service provider on the same route, but, of course, many types of tickets cannot be used with other providers.   TPE could negotiate for these restrictions to be waived but they have not.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

She said that it was her seat, and had her ticket to prove it (I didn’t ask to see it). I ended up sitting the floor in the vestibule waiting for conductor. I explained to the conductor what had happened. She said that she had just tried to tell the same lady to move because, as it turns out, she WAS sitting in the wrong seat. The lady refused to move, so the conductor bumped me up to first class free of charge. I was very well taken care of by lovely staff - will use this service again.The train was crowded but the staff were lovely and the train ran exactly to schedule.

Now on the way back, the journey was delayed. What was supposed to be a 3 and a half hour journey became an 8-hour journey? I'm writing this review whilst trying to get through to customer service about a refund it has already been 30 minutes.

2018-08-16T15:51:28Z	Here to help? Are you having a larff?	Never had any issues previously  with TPE but their 'Live Chat' is clearly some sort of Fawlty Towers Call Centre joke.Made an error on Monday booking tickets. Totally my fault. Realised almost immediately. No probs, just use the amend button and pay the fee. Two hours later decided to contact 'live chat. First 'agent' cut out half way through. Tried again.  Next 'agent'  tried to resolve unable to, advised try another browser instead of Chrome, donee same issue, give it 24 hours try again. OK. Did. Same issue. Straight on to ' live chat' rather than was time. A few texts backwards and forwards concluding with you are probably to amend to early since you are not travelling until Sept(?????) so leave it (????) or go to your local station and they might sort it(?????) That'll be the Northern station where one guy sells tickets, provides advice,stops people jumping the barriers, makes announcements. That's when it's not too early, not to late, on day off with no cover.  At least they have a dedicated cleaner.Transpennine Express Live Chat = Waste Your Time. Even three e mails I have sent have been ignored. Not even a computerised acknowledgement of receipt. 😈😈😈😈😈Given up on getting any response from Transpennine Express after two nights spending an hour the last two nights trying to resolve. Decided just   to purchase tickets for the correct train without bothering with the amendments. AMAZINGLY EVEN THOUGH I INPUTTED EXACTLY THE SAME INFO FOR PAYMENT WHICH WAS ZERO ON THE AMENDMENT AND £19.10 FOR NEW TICKETS IT WENT THROUGH IMMEDIATELY.     STRANGE THAT!!!!!!!  In future I will be using Grand Centrals website for all ticket purchases. ( Even though i was getting told Zero i suspect I would have been charged £20  for the amendment so i have probably saved myself .90p. My advice if you have any problem with TPE don't bother with Live Chat - you probably know more than them - and don't bother sending any e mails they seem to be going to the   Space Station because no one at TPE is reading them. Bye Bye TPE website unfortunately cannot avoid your trains24 07 18Lucky I didn't wait for any response to my emails.

We were crammed in and had to stand to Penrith. I am 65. All the seats had reserved signs on and were full. We found out that none were reserved and TE put reserved tickets on so that no one would sit in them to save on cleaning. Disgusting. I wrote a complaint with the promise of a reply in 5 days. Guess what. Nothing 10 days later. We returned home on A virgin train with reserved seat which cost a third of the TE tickets and it was direct. Won't use TE again. Avoid at all cost.

Trying to deal with customer services to get a refund for delays is awful. They have policies to deliberately complicate the process and avoid repayment.

2018-08-16T15:51:28Z	First Class is a disgrace.	Manchester to Glasgow.11.15 departure.First class.The service is supposed to have 4 carriages. Coach D not existent. No seats, passengers crowing into every standing space possible. In coach C which is supposed to be 1st class four seats are cordoned off with red rope. This exacerbates the shortage of seating. The service attendant offered his 1st class passengers one hot drink and a small margarita fro box containing 2 crackers, one small cheese portion, the smallest 10 g packet of bagels and crisps together with a one small mouth fool of chocolate. The first class coach is filthy. Spillages on the floor and rubbish everywhere. First class! This is a complete joke, a comedy show. Unfortunately I have to use this service and there is no consistency whatsoever. Trans Pennine managers should abandon the concept of ‘first class’ or revise their pricing  structure so that they can offer a modicum of service, train their staff and stop cheatin* the public. Their perception of ‘first class’ is non existent and they are selling these tickets under false pretences.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1
2018-08-16T15:51:28Z	Lost ticket, no help from company	I booked a ticket online with home delivery. Unfortunately I lost the paper ticket before travelling and I immediately contacted the customer service (both phone and email) to seek assistance. Even if I had a booking reference and confirmation email, they didn't issue a copy of the ticket or didn't even give me the chance to collect from a ticket machine. According to them, I had to buy a new full price ticket even if I had evidence of my reservation. They tried to scare me mentioning a possible fine on the train if trying to use my email reservation. I decided to get on the train with no paper ticket anyway and the ticket inspector was kind enough to accept my booking email as a proof of the ticket. Phone and online customer service was very unhelpful, it looks like this company doesn't care a lot about customers. Thumb up for the ticket inspector which used his common sense.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	2
2018-03-11T20:55:44Z	I purchased a return ticket through the…	I purchased a return ticket through the tpexpress.co.uk website a week or so before I intended to travel from Preston to Leeds on the 3rd, March. Due to snow many if not all trains were cancelled or severely delayed between Manchester and Leeds and the advice was not to travel. I therefore decided to cancel my trip on the 2nd, March a day before I was intending to travel. I hadn't collected my tickets from the station.On telephoning them on the 2nd, March I was told I would be sent a form to claim my refund. This was never sent so today 11th, March I spoke to a woman called Debbie who was not at all helpfu. I queried why my refund hadn't been processed and that why in 2018 I was being asked to complete a form and post it back, when in reality the trains were cancelled by tpexpress not by me and that I had no tickets to return.In my opinion TPExpress are simply causing the refund process to be drawn out in the hope that many will forget or not follow up the refund.Bazaar. I have now completed the form and emailed it back only to be told that I have to post it at my cost.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

The weather was horrendous and due to snow many trains had been delayed or cancelled, but Steve kindly made sure we knew our next connection times and even want as far as to make sure we caught out train.  A true gentleman and highly deserving of some recognition - he clearly loves his job and I personally wish him every success for the future.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	5

2018-03-11T20:55:44Z	Horrible customer service	Horrible customer service! My grandma and I were on our way back to Leeds from Newcastle (Via York) and the train was cancelled. Instead of our original train, we had to catch a later one into York then wait around another hour before we could get a train into Leeds. Of course, we're angry about this so we apply for a refund. Not only does it take months to finally hear back from them, but they can only offer a small percentage refund of the price we paid - they use a scheme of how much a passenger is delayed to determine the refund. I would be okay with this If it weren't for the fact that not only was our train in fact cancelled and not delayed, but the only train we could get to our destination was crowded and my elderly grandmother had to stand for the entire journey! We had booked seats on our original train, especially so that this would not happen. Very disappointed.In short; A delay is not the same as a cancelled journey.Don't bother with transpennine; If anything happens, you won't be seeing your money again for a very long time (if ever).	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1
2018-03-11T20:55:44Z	Disgraceful service for exorbitant ticket price!	Regularly use TPE to commute to/from work and am continuously appalled at the poor standard of service - regularly late/delayed and frequently the service only has two carriages instead of 4 on a peak hour service (Liverpool-Norwich service) resulting in the train being standing room only when it arrives on the platform at Warrington.  In recent months, there have been instances when the train has left passengers stranded on the platform because it was already overcrowded. As a season ticket holder this is unacceptable yet the terms of carriage published by TPE state that they are not obligated to ensure passengers have a seat for their journey. The ridiculous excuses that we are given include 'animals on the track'; heavy congestion in the area; Using the compensation claim form takes ages and results in a refund of a third of the ticket price for delays of more than 30 minutes.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1
2018-03-11T20:55:44Z	Staff use intimidating harassing bullying behaviour - be warned	If I could give this company a rating of a negative number I would. I am a regular traveller on these trains, main journey Huddersfield to Leeds return as I travel to London frequently. However, I have tried to complain / notify them of a particular service I received and there is nothing they have done about it. I am a young single female travelling on these trains at all different times of day and night. The train conductor used intimidating harrassing bullying type of behaviour towards me, which has affected me now where I cannot travel on trains on my own. I notified transpenine straight away, they did nothing, no response not even an apology, even though I sent evidence. I then asked a third party organisation to help me with my complaint, again transpenine took no responsibility and passed the blame to a different train provider. When the service and staff I complained about worked for transpenine - this makes no sense to me. I then went even higher to inform the trading standards. I have now refused to travel on these trains and make my journeys via alternative routes. I would never recommend or use their device again. So be warned especially if you are travelling on your own and the conductor knows they can treat you in any way, as the company does nothing about it.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	1

They are so good and I got 2 time refund for my travel what I don't need it anymore. So bad is to book with TransPennine Express. Please go to Trainline and book with them and be sure you don't take the ticket before you are 100% sure you travel. If you don't travel, you can get your money back.

2018-03-11T20:55:44Z	I've been travelling with transpennie …	I've been travelling with transpennie express trains for many years now they have good customer service always on time clean toilets OK but not that many only two toilets on board. The only downside is they don't do food on board even on long train trips I did the Grimsby to Glasgow train journey last June overall it took nine hours journey There was no proper food on board only biscuits or cakes no sandwiches no hot or cold food the person came round with a trolley of hot and cold drinks at £2.55 for one cup of hot tea it is expensive. But the conductor on board was great he said I could go first class because the carriage was full passengers was sitting on the floor next to the emergency door. The train had been over booked you couldn't get anymore passengers on that train, if there had been a train crash or derailment then passengers could have been really seriously injuried or killed there was at least 12 passengers sitting on the floor next to the emergency door Due to health and safety reasons this was why I was moved to first class without paying extra money for a ticket. Coming back home on transpennie express was not a good experience i had a quiet area with window seat but again i wasnt asked if i wanted any food when the trolly came out there was no hot or cold food again just cakes biscuits and crisps to be on a long journey like over 6 hours from Glasgow to Grimsby with out being offered hot food i had to ask a couple of times for a hot drink which i find pretty appalling. To pay £2.55 for one cuppa to is just over priced	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	2
2018-03-11T20:55:44Z	Lost luggage	My colleague left his ruck sack on one of the Transpennine  trains, I got in touch with Transpennine and spoke with a lady who was not able to do much for me. However she gave me the contact number for the terminating station and they told me to contact network rail and then network rail told me to contact Transpennine. After being passed from pillar to post, I called back Transpennine and spoke with a helpful gentleman called Paulo, he contacted the control room at the terminating station and spoke with a lovely gentleman Mark(conductor) who offered to return the bag to the station I got off. The service I received from Paul was greatly appreciated and also Mark, a horrible experience turned out to be outstanding. We should have more people like Paul on the phone and people like Mark on the trains.

2020-11-11T13:38:08Z	Often problems	I often use their train service from Huddersfield to Manchester Airport and there is often a problem of one sort or another. The worst I have experienced was for a flight and I arrived at Huddersfield station to be greeted by the message all trains to Manchester Airport are cancelled. You can imagine how that feels if you have a flight. The next worst was a train to the airport that stopped in central Manchester and they announced it would not be going to the airport, which caused everyone to panic. They put on a coach to the airport but I didn't want to risk that being too slow, so I had to take a taxi. They wouldn't reimburse the taxi fare.I sometimes use their app. When I tried to use it recently it wouldn't let me log in. I tried resetting the password and even deleting the app and reinstalling but neither helped. I contacted their online chat but they were unable to help. I asked that the problem be forwarded to their technical department but they said they were unable to do that. I emailed their customer support who took about four days to reply. They said they couldn't help as I should have emailed web support not customer support. They could have forwarded my email to web support themselves.I recently booked a first class seat from Manchester Airport to York. The price was about double the normal price - I see they are taking advantage of people wanting to socially distance. Normally in first class they offer an included drink and biscuit - they did not do that. I'm sure their excuse is it's because of covid. Nobody came to check my ticket or came to check the first class customers. At least the train was on time and the carriage was clean.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.tpexpress.co.uk	2

On boarding the train it was packed solid, full and standing, including vestibules. The train manager was in the vestibule. I explained my disabilities and their ""disabled peoples protection policy"" along with my carer and was told to sit, on the floor, in the vestibule until the train emptied out. I pointed out i was not happy with the response and was told i could have a senior managers email and mob no if i wasnt happy. Because of my disabilities i was unable to get up from the floor and suffered all the way to kings cross. I contacted hull trains today, 28/10/2019 and was fobbed off as the lady i spoke to wasnt interested. She also had no idea of what their ""disabled peoples protection policy"" was.They are well know in the railway industry as ""DULL TRAINS"" Its ironic that their M.D. Ms Cheeseman mentions, in their onboard magazine, boasts about being the no1 train operating company in a few years and has, in the past."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.hulltrains.co.uk	1
2020-10-12T14:17:29Z	Absolutely shocking	Absolutely shockingI have been using Hull Trains for years and I am a frequent user of Hull Trains, recently the service has been appalling, cancelling trains last minute. My Train was completely cancelled on the 9th due to power failure. I have put in for compensation and heave heard nothing back from them, I called up customer services just to ensure they have received the claim and they completely fobbed me off by saying that it will be 20 working days before I receive anything which goes against their T&C's on their website. They had complete disregard and didn't even attempt to provide a solution.Use another train company to get where you are going, unreliable and not really bothered about the customer, which was never the case a couple of years ago	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.hulltrains.co.uk	1
2020-10-12T14:17:29Z	Cancellation nightmare	My train from Kings Cross to Hull has been cancelled for the 3rd time. It is due to a fault on the train again. I have been charged £112 to take the 17.22 direct to Hull so I don't have to get a train to Doncaster and then travel by road or wait until nearly 8pm to arrive home at 11pm. I tried to claim compensation last time but the website would not submit my claim.I have seen numerous cancellations on the early morning service from Beverley to London recently. This is not an acceptable service and I will not be taking Hull trains again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.hulltrains.co.uk	1
2020-10-12T14:17:29Z	Good experience	My East Midlands train Sheffield to London was cancelled owing to a trackside fire, so had to travel via Doncaster. I was allowed on to the 0710 Hull Trains train with no extra payment even though, I was told, there is no reciprocal agreement with East Midlands. Staff told me this was a goodwill gesture. Pleasant on board staff, and litter was collected twice during the journey, which was fast and comfortable.Confusingly, this train was in GWR livery!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.hulltrains.co.uk	4

2020-10-12T14:17:29Z	Oh dear	Oh dear. Hull trains cancelled both my outward and return journeys in early October. I had to book new tickets with LNER and submitted a compensation claim with Hull.

Poor performance all round.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.hulltrains.co.uk	1

2020-10-29T20:13:15Z	Disappointing and apologetic response to loyal customer - will not use again!	I was mis-sold a ticket at Waterloo for the London to Plymouth Via Honiton service. I paid the full price of £101 for a flexible ticket only to hear that the train ticket was not valid as the service was completely down due to repairs, no refund was available and I was advised to make my own way to London Paddington at my own expense to try to blag my way onto a Great Western service. No details were provided as to how to return the ticket or any compensation offered by customer service even though I called them directly on the day as well as speaking to a South Western customer representative at Waterloo. I later contacted the email complaints and asked if I could exchange the return ticket to use at a later date but was given a flat no and that there was could do nothing as outside their standard returns policy of 28 days. However they took no responsibility for the specific circumstances that do not match the standard returns policy as the ticket was mis-sold and that two of their representatives had failed in providing advice on the return policy. It seems SWR show no regard to loyal customers or decency in offering compensation or an apology for their failure to provide the service that was paid for but not received. I will now switch to Great Western Railway moving forwards.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1
2020-10-29T20:13:15Z	Absolute Shambles !!!	I don’t often use SWR but every time I do the story is always the same - it is late, significantly so. While any lateness is unforgivable in major European capital in the 21st century, this was exacerbated by the fact that intercom announcements were so quiet that even with good sense of hearing they were impossible to hear. I have was late for an important meeting due to this lousy service despite allowing myself plenty of time	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1
2020-10-29T20:13:15Z	I don’t often use SWR but every time I…	I know that all companies are having a bad time at the moment but South Western Rail really are dire.  I've been commuting on SWR for the last 17 years, during which times I've spent tens of thousands on rail tickets.  Now that everyone has been advised not to travel unless it's essential and the Government has said the rail companies will refund people for tickets they don't use, it should be easy to get tickets refunded, although I appreciate it may take a little time.  But SRW has competely closed down all communication if you have a problem with refunds - they are not taking any calls on their customer service line, they have posted that they are not replying to any facebook queries and their SWR twitter is useless, facile comments as replies that are no use whatever. However, the real problem is that the refund process is time sensitive - although it doesn't say this in the announcement about refunds on the SWR website, you have to apply for the refund and return the physical tickets before the intended date of travel.  I stayed at home on the first day the refund process was announced, 23rd March, as instructed by the Government but, when I wanted to apply for a refund for 23rd March, I couldn't because the date of travel had passed and it seems I should also have returned the tickets to SWR before the date of travel - clearly impossible to return the tickets by 23rd March when it was only announced on 23rd March that refunds would be made.  I then returned 8 tickets to SWR for later journeys, they refunded 6 and ignored the other 2.   I then sent a further 8 tickets, which they've completely failed to do anything about.  I can see that it's possible they will say they didn't arrive but they posted by me in good faith.  For the next lot of tickets, I resorted to going to the post office to send them recorded delivery.  So, although we are not supposed to make unnecessary journeys, I had to make a trip to the station to get the tickets printed and another trip to the post office to send them recorded delivery.  Next, I tried to apply for a refund for a journey in early May but it has no refund option on the drop down menu.  Normally, I would ring customer service and ask for their advice - but you can't do that because they're still shut down.  If you email you only get an acknowledgement but no resolution of anything.  Surely after 3 and a half weeks of lockdown, they should have got their customer service into some kind of working shape.  And given that 95% of people have not travelled since instructed to stay at home by the Government, why do they need people to return their tickets.  Surely, they should just refund them.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1
2020-10-29T20:13:15Z	Dire customer service	Although I understand the problems people have with delays, ticket prices etc, I also think it's worth noting the good things sometimes. The train station at Wokingham, Berkshire is always clean, tidy and has very friendly staff. One particular station announcer would read poems and stories to commuters across the tannoy and make witty banter with passers by. Those sort of people are the ones who do great work and deserve recognition, even if the company may be ran a little shoddy.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1
2020-10-29T20:13:15Z	Wokingham, Berkshire- friendly and helpful staff	Honestly, to say a rating of one star would be insulting to other companies rated one star, is the biggest understatement since “Brexit is going to screw us”.This company is quite amazing. Amazing because it takes genuine skill to be this bad. It takes genuine skill to psychologically torture your customers, to inconvenience them in every way possible, and then to have them be forced to pay for it while offering a horrid Delay Repay scheme. The trains run by, and stations managed by, Southwestern Railway are a Briton’s own bespoke hellhole, catering to your every pet peeve and pushing all your buttons.The staff and managers of this company deserve their own private VIP box in hell for this. I write this as I wait for a train to take me to a stop that’s a half hour walk from where I live because SWR couldn’t run their train on time and so I missed my original connecting one. I also had to wait about 40 mins this very morning at Woking Station on my way to work for the same reason, and mind you, the only extraordinary thing about this for me is that it was a 40 min wait and not their this-train-is-delayed-by-20-mins wait.Privatise the railways, my foot. The Tories can go to hell.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	3
2020-10-29T20:13:15Z	Speechless	The worst train company in existence in the UK and I look forward to them losing the franchise. Regular cancellations, delays almost every single day and IMO a flippant and arrogant attitude to their customers. The ticket prices are extortionate for the reliability of service provided. They make for the most miserable commute - missing meetings, getting home very late to my family and not compensating customers appropriately, if at all. Delays are almost daily. I have personally had 17 delayed journeys back to back, followed by a month of strikes over December 2019. Now further strikes are in the pipeline for Q1 2020. The profiteering by SWR and the shambles service they provide is an abuse of the UK's major national infrastructure and the UK Government should have stepped in long ago and dealt with it.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1

2020-10-29T20:13:15Z	Darren	Have failed on EVERY part of their service since they took on the franchise. Customer complaints are ignored regularly.  trains are delayed and cancelled, my train in the last 3 months arrived on time less than 10% of the time. Staff are ignorant or past caring. Delay repay is deliberately complicated and they deliberately reject the first claim. Refuse to listen to customer suggestions. Service takes an eternity to recover once something goes wrong, which is every day. Removed free weekend travel for season ticket holders. Completely lost relations with the guards. Late implementation of new trains. Poor communication of engineering work. Meet the manager sessions are a complete waste of time. Regularly skip stations which infuriated everyone involved but they claim it helps them restore service levels, which it never does and never will. I may have missed a few things, but you can guarantee they failed on that too. If they were a dog they’d have been put down a long long long tome ago.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1

I woke up to a new timetable this morning, to find the services from brookwood in the crucial 7 - 8 o/clock period reduced from 4 to 3 trains, or is the ridiculous pre-christmas strike still on?Before the strike, most of the trains I took into London in the  morning were late.  There is no focus on service.This franchise is utterly hopeless.  All they are interested in is checking tickets and maximising revenue and there is no focus on service.No doubt there will be a unwarranted increase in ticket price to go with this appalling service.  I agree with the other reviewers, one star is too much - bring back SWT!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1

The CEO receives regular emails from me as SWR punctuality is so utterly abysmal the guy needs reminding.That I pay a year in advance for such pap is a major lament.SWR is a reason to call in the franchise for repudiatory breach of its charter. The metrics are so poor on any objective analysis.Strikes run for months etc too. Never a seat, old stok cars put back on line due to procurement failings.Good to see others go into print as SWR do stuff all  about it.

2020-10-29T20:13:15Z	I to have used SWR since they took over…	I have been a gold card holder since 2009, a decade now. For the first time, I have been told that losing my season ticket which I purchased for thousands of pounds a year requires a process of at least a week's investigation and possibly interview to eliminate fraud. I lodged my complaint on 13 December and have had no feedback, except being contacted once to find out 'how I lost the ticket'. Really?! Is it beyond the realms of possibility to lose a paper ticket on a busy commute when it is not a touch and pay card but a manual one that requires removing from its safe wallet and using manually? While I can fully appreciate this, a more efficient, fairer, customer friendly approach would be to ensure that such expensive tickets can be cancelled when lost, rather than put busy customers through the ordeal of buying expensive new tickets for reimbursement later, thereby putting them out of pocket. This is indeed a service that takes advantage of the lack of options for the customer. I am stuck with SWT from Woking to Waterloo as there are no alternatives. SWT please please review this new policy. It is completely outrageous. There are no words to express my frustration, stress and shock at this experience. I have already logged a formal complaint and of course, no one has reverted to me even though it has been over a week.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1
2020-10-29T20:13:15Z	I have been a gold card holder since…	Even before the (unjustified) train strike the service on the Shepperton Line has been incompetent after SWR took over. In the morning rush hour trains are constantly late and then run fast from Teddington to Waterloo.Since the strike it's just been a disaster: no trains at all at the weekend, two hour gaps in the service during the day, and no service after about 21:00 hours.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1
2020-10-29T20:13:15Z	Even before the (unjustified) train…	I thought all trains were like SWR but after using GWR it really shows how horrific SWR is. Old trains, bad Aircon, uncomfortable seats and cramped.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1

Well, at least acceptable words anyway.Even when there are no strikes or industrial actions taking place, I risk loosing my job every day through the unreliability of the service and complete lack of respect for customers. Now, during the month of December, it is.... well, I’m lost for words. Take a look at the daily track record for the Shepperton line. At every day! There is no other option for us that travel from this area and SWR know that. Plans to turns this into a shuttle service will be snuck in in the new year no doubt. SWR should be ashamed of themselves. But there not. They are still getting paid out of the public purse so sit with their fingers firmly stuck up at us. You should all be ashamed.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	2

Very frequent strikes with passengers always being the losers.The decision by SWR to strike 27 days during the cold winter, and Christmas period, is beyond the final straw. Ticket prices are extortionate even for a service that runs at 90% quality. The figure for SWR is about 10%.And any compensation/refund offered for the numerous strikes, cancellations or delays? Of course not. This says it all.A complete circus masquerading as a company. The fact that ordinary, every-day people choose to put up with this, and swallow/accept it, is simply saddening.The only good news is that I believe the end is nigh for SWR.

So far, not too bad.But things got worse....At Basingstoke, without any warning, all passengers were told to get off as the train was terminating!! NO EXPLANATION. Nobody telling us which train to move to. Mass exodus through the subway to a train we thought was going to Waterloo. It did...eventually...arriving 55 mins late as it stopped at all the small stations en route. Hence I was late getting to by son who was taking his wife out that evening and I was baby sitting for them.Absolutely deplorable. My return train 2 days later left Waterloo 10 mins late and was only 2 carriages!!...luckily I got a seat but others had to stand. The 'guard' made no attempt to wheel the refreshment trolley down the carriage but sat in his own area expecting people to come to him for a coffee etc (no announcement was made that he was there..I found him there by chance)Next time I'll drive up...at least I'll get there when I want to!To cap it all the guards are going on strike.... again.... meaning HUGE inconvenience to my family travelling from London.

2019-12-03T22:12:47Z	Poor Service	I am a college student who catches the train from Axminster to Exeter. On the way home today from Exeter I was waiting for the 3:30 train to get home ready in plenty of time for going to work. As a young person my age is need to pay for driving lessons, car, insurance, college trips, a rail card and many more letting know that I also need to save for the future So going to work is important. The 3:30 train was cancelled so I had to then wait for another hour for the train  back still hoping to get home to work in time. When the 4:30 train then got to the station it was only 3 coaches long with everyone person waiting from the 3:30 train, other people waiting from from finish shopping or work so it was extremely busy when I was about to board the train I decided to try and help a lady with two you kids, a pram and shopping to get on the train as she was waiting for an hour already when at the front of the train she was told she was unable and the rest of us waiting was kicked off the train. After this we went to see if mg friend and I was able to get a refund on her ticket and asked why their was only 3 coaches. We was answered with the fact it not their fault we should of finished college quicker when we had been waiting for over an hour already and was then direct to a supervisor which we was told would give up a taxi home. When see the supervisor we was told quite abruptly that it not her fault and she doesn’t have to do anything to help us. I would of even got the 4:43 train back to honiton which means I would be able to get a lift back however this was also cancelled and so was another one to Axminster. Now I would worry so much about it apart from the fact I pay £800 a year on a ticket which means I can get to Exeter and back and this has happened many time before but this is the final straw.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1

The train from woolston became so unreliable we had to stop catching it.On top of this the customer service is abysmal and then we get Mick Cash and his merry RMT striking campaign about safety. The constant strikes cause mayhem and disruption to everyones lives but not to Mick Cash himself. The only safety is how much Cash he is pocketing (£160k per year). What a disgusting, divisive, disruptive and despicable man.Then when it comes to compensation South Western barely give any recompense whatsoever and then keep raising the train fares. How do they get away with this?

After having spoken to my 5th person at SWR, I was informed that I should've actually been offered a travel voucher rather than told to purchase another ticket and await a refund for the original. It should also not have taken in excess of two weeks to send a refund which was confirmed as stilll on a colleagues ""to do list"" over online chat a few days previous.I proceeded to then provide my card details over the phone so the late payment to my account could be made instantly. 6 days later and refund STILL not recieved.Not good enough.

It would never have occurred to me to buy a ticket before travelling.2  after leaving Clapham Junction the train manager trots out the same tired message about keeping belongings safe etc.  Most sentient adults are well aware of the need to look after their belongings and there are plenty of notices in the train about safety.3  SWR's website asking for feedback doesn't allow you to put in any contact email or phone number for SWR to get back to you - in other words, they are not the least bit interested.4  ""Please mind the gap"" - again, most adults are well aware of a gap between the train and the platform edge.If any of SWR's management ever travelled by train, they would be aware of these stupidities.  They could take a leaf out of Chiltern Railways where journeys are accomplished in peace and quiet - and on time.What a pity Trustpilot doesn't allow a zero star rating."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1

2019-12-03T22:12:47Z	SWR - you are bad, I mean really bad.	This company only can be described as a not-funny joke. In last 2 weeks trains were canceled, delayed or did not stop on the station is supposed to. I do use it as my daily commute to London and after last 2 weeks, I do have enough. SWR should be embarrassed by their performance and refund scheme is just pathetic( £1.97 compensation when I’ve paid £26 for a ticket ).	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1

After submitting an FOI request to network rail, I was unsurprised to learn that, in the last year, close to 70% of their trains arriving at Waterloo between 7am and 9am were delayed. How can the company justify continued fare increases when the service is so bad?

They are a monopoly and we have no choice as commuters. The objective of using the train is to get from a to b in x time and on the time promised. SWR are ALWAYS late! When is the UK government going to wake up and do something for its citizens? Every day train later 10 to 15mn. Every day they apologise and sometimes not. Then you have the real bug delays if 30mn.

2019-09-24T19:59:47Z	NEGATIVE STARS as they clearly HATE us customers	My second ever trust pilot review, driven by pure fury at the SWR experience.  Designed to make it near impossible for customers to claim for the frequent delays and early terminations.  When you persist (on principle) through the process, they don’t have available options to reflect the variety of pain they inflict... so then they decline the puny claim which doesn’t even come close to compensating for your experience without detailing why.  Attempting to appeal is even more difficult than the assault course of claiming in the first place.  They clearly hate their customers.  I only wish it were possible to give negative stars.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1
2019-09-24T19:59:47Z	South Western Railway is an affront	South Western Railway is an affront to British transport. Having just returned from a holiday in Italy - where the trains run like clockwork in 45° heat round steep mountains during a strike - I found my evening train from Clapham junction cancelled at 6 minutes notice. This is the first time I have used a train in a year. And little to my surprise, South Western Railway has failed me again. If it weren’t so bloody inconvenient, the shocking incompetence would be funny. But here’s the real string. It costs double the price in England to make a journey of half the distance in Italy. DO NOT TAKE THE TRAIN. DRIVE!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1

Even during rush hour the trains are full yet not as crowded as the Tube (if you live/work in London will understand it better). Costumer support, I used once and was incredible experience: Easy to communicate and issue was resolve first try. Don't understand why the negativity on reviewing a company based on delays... Overall very good service. The only cons are that by the end of the day, some trains have rubbish scattered around the carriages...

All passengers prepared to get off but the guard did not open the doors, forgot!! (no any information was given during the journey). I got in trouble with my company as I arrived late to my job and I had to pay £4.20 + 2.80 (instead of 3.10) as I had to go back to Vauxhall. People arrived at Waterloo station and tried to contact the driver but he refused to speak with the passengers, being rude and shut the door in our faces. The guard who forgot to open the doors even did not come out of his ""office"". I complained and asked for a refund. SWR Trains refused the request, informing that I was not entitled to any refund because the train did not arrive late! This is ridiculous, unprofessional, unethical. Their motto should be ""We don't care""!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1

2019-09-24T19:59:47Z	SWR - Southwest was good until it became SouthWestern....	SWR are dishonest about the delays they cause to my journeys. I am not happy for the followign reasons:1) Delay caused to my journey2) Dishonesty and wrongly rejecting my claims - this is usually the first response (possibly an automated email) and I believe that SWR are trying to put people off from claiming3) Making me claim several times before I am given compensation. SWR always give different reasons as to why my claims are rejected. At first, the reason was that my ticket is illegible. This is not true. After complaining about this several times, the new reason was that I need to provide the receipt as opposed to the Oyster Card. On submitting this, I am told that I need to submit proof of zones covered and cost of ticket. So I provided the receipt (which shows the cost of the ticket) and screenshot of my Oyster account which shows the date and zones covered. The next reason was that they need to see the journey history! Now that I have provided this, SWR are still rejecting my claims? I have managed to claim via TravelWatch in the past (over £170 over the past year), but the government has placed new rules which means that TravelWatch can no longer intervene.4) If trains are cancelled, the reason for rejecting my claim is the fact I abandoned the journey. This is not an appropriate reason to reject my claim - the only reason why I had abandoned my journey was the fact that my trains had been cancelled due to strikes! 5) Strikes are inappropriate - if the company doesn't need you, they don't need you. Many people are made redundant every year and they have no say in whether they stay or go and therefore this should be the case for SWR staff - nobody should be making money for nothing as this is known as theft. Besides, I have seen disabled people asking the guards for help and many of the SWR staff are quite rude e.g. shouting at them for asking them for help. If assisting customers isn't their job - what is? Do they get paid to blow a whistle?6) Increased fares - it's funny how SWR aren't even ashamed of charging customers more without any improvement in service. This in my opinion, is thieving. People don't get a pay rise every year, nor better train services so why does the fare go up every year?7) Monopoly - I believe the main reason why SWR are not improving their services is the fact that they are the only service providing trains in the South West area and therefore people have no choice but to use the poor services regardless of the cost.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1

Almost every return journey is late; delayed or cancelled and SWR blaming their performance on the infrastructure they inherited is a poor excuse, and untrue, as the previous operator ran a much better service.

2018-11-27T20:30:43Z	Absolutely abysmal	Absolutely abysmal. I so wish South West were back. At least then there was more reliability to times and service overall. This franchise is a joke. Even platform staff agree now with open hostility towards the company.Now almost every single day the train is late. On average 10 mins but over time this really accumulates. The 15 delay repay should be based on aggregated time delays both ways and I would get compensation every day!Apart from always being late - many Trains often cancelled without warning. And now the new practice of changing stops or even skipping stops to try and make up time with no consideration to the traveller. If you live in any rural area you are doomed with this new practice. Sometimes I get home 45 mins late and this is happening too regularly. DO NOT SKIP STOPS.As a commuter to London every day I pay a fortune for such a crap service. It really is not acceptable.With possible timetable changes ahead in 2019 I absolutely expect the service to completely fail	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1

No postcode etc so not surprisingly the letter comes back to you as UNDELIVERED.There is no mention whatsoever of posting the Tickets when you complete the on-line form.Why the website Claim information cannot say POST THE TICKETS today rather than all the unnecessary delay and messing around.My advice is to not  bother with the on-line claim, post your claim as Signed For mail and add the cost to your claim.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1

Since taking over from SouthWestTrains, the trains are more cramped and less punctual, which is impressive when you consider that almost every single train used to be late. I've never seen so many cancelled trains before. Now the smart card system has been 'improved', which is why it's no longer possible to actually buy a ticket with a smart card. Now I'm on hold and I'm being flung between 5 seconds of canned music and 2 different adverts for their own services.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1

2018-03-13T13:34:25Z	Oxymoron	When you encounter such unreliable, inconsistent and poorly communicated service as SWR, it would help slightly if you could rely on a reasonably quick (I mean what, 3 days?) response time to queries. But it’s even worse than their train service. I’ve had a holding email after a month! I pity the poor souls who work there. It must be horrible - picking up the pieces of their awful train service, under resourced, completely impersonal.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1
2018-03-13T13:34:25Z	A poor start to a new franchise	South Western Railway (who took over the franchise previously held by South West Trains late August 2017) took control of the franchise at an unfortunate time - during extensive engineering works which severely impacted services into London Waterloo station (and, as predicted, overran). They have also had infrastructure issues to deal with, which may well be beyond their control.However, on balance, I feel this one-star rating fairly reflects their inadequate response so far to issues which may not be in their direct control, but should hardly come as a surprise to them. In particular:- During the Waterloo works, they reduced services (for example, on the 24th August) at short notice to 25% of the regular and advised customers not to travel. It has just been advised that there will be no refund to season ticket holders in respect of days on which we were advised not to travel. I believe this is in breach of consumer rights. South West trains made a blanket 'void day' declaration for the period covered by the Waterloo works - which was reasonable given the disruption to services (disruption which we were not aware of at the time of season ticket purchase).- Information is poor. On three occasions in September, trains were held 30minutes past their scheduled departure time without any on-train announcements. These trains became dangerously overcrowded.I have travelled on services upon which the destination changed, leaving customers confused. - Trains no longer appear to be cleaned as thoroughly or as frequently as under the prior franchise- 'Gold card' benefits offered by South West trains have been withdrawn without notice.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southwesternrailway.com	1

If you know anything about Google then you will understand . My only conclusion is the site just wants you to give up and go away .In short don't waste your time just visit local train station and get refund via good old pen and paper.Its free post and just a form which according to website can be  obtained  from local train station .I wasted over two hours ."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

I was travelling from Runcorn to Liverpool which is a whopping £7.50 return for a 10 minute journey. I only had cash to pay with which the machines don’t take and there was no one at the stands. My wife and I were fined £20 each when we arrived at the station by goons in a uniform. I had cash out ready to pay when the thug approached me attempting to intimidate me with his tone of voice.

Shocking was told not to worry about getting a refund or re booking for a later date by various modes of contact telephone, twitter and email prior to the date of my travel which needed to be cancelled due to the covid 19 virus. I couldn't do it online without paying the normal charge of £8 per ticket but upon stating why were they keeping this charge when all the other operators I checked were waiving the penalty fees due to the virus and offering people the chance to rebook or get a full refund. They suggested I send a ticket query and not to worry it would be sorted. Well last time I listen to your customer service as was told I could get no refund and as date of travel had passed nothing they could do. Ended up going round in circles so have taken this to the Rail Ombudsman cannot state how poor they have been at every level and obviously profiteering out of this national emergency I will never be using these jokers again!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2020-03-19T19:49:50Z	terribleeee	Not worth one star! Shame I can’t put no stars to this review. I write this in the hope something will soon be done about the shocking service! You are costing people their jobs!! I’ve spoken to countless people who have had to give up their careers because they can’t rely on this car crash of a train service. Trains are cancelled daily, with no explanation as to why and always at late notice! This is the only train service even slightly close to me and I’m always late to work or can’t make it at all! it doesn’t matter at what time you have planned for a train, delays are shocking across the entire daily service (if you can call it that). It takes over a month or not at all to get a response from a complaint. Weeks to get a delay repay refund and you never receive 100% of your money back. Countless times I’ve had to pay for taxis because I’m stranded somewhere with no replacement bus service and NEVER have any of these expenses been compensated by the London north western. This is not a train service, this is a joke.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-03-19T19:49:50Z	Not worth one star	Words cannot describe the poor service and ineptitude of this rail service into London. Constant cancellations at short notice and it’s pretty much given that every train is delayed.They have managed to surpass the incompetence of London Midland to such a degree that I can only think that they pride themselves on being the worst train service in the country.The staff genuinely don’t seem to care and the communication at the stations and on the trains is often non existent.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2020-03-19T19:49:50Z	Avoid London North West Trains if you can	"After the train (which didn't have a single working toilet on board) broke down and everyone waited for 45 minutes just to be told to alight and find another way to continue the journey, I had to use an alternative service to get to London and arrived more than 90 minutes later than expected; then, after exhaustively filling in several forms online to get a refund from the cancelled service, I had my reclaim denied because I could not submit a copy of the spoiled ticket as proof that I would not use it again.The said ticked was valid on the day of travel only, so how could I use it again two days later? This is not a plausible reason for denying the repay.So, the company is just posing a huge barrier for me to receive what was advertised as something very simple to be done.So, from now I will make every possible effort not to use this service again, for this company uses very dreaded trains with broken toilets throughout, that don't manage to reach the destination, and their ""Delay We Pay"" policy is just not true. My conclusion is: London Northwestern Railway is a company that does not comply with their promises. The train does not arrive on time (or does not arrive at all) and repay for delayed services is just designed for you to give up during the process."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

I pay plus £400 a month to commute into Euston from Berkhamsted on a daily basis and have done for the past 11 years.

2020-01-20T15:48:01Z	London Notgoinganywhere Railways	I thought I would write this little review because I have so much time to waste due to delayed broken down cancelled slow running you nameit they have it London Northwestern trains and as usual today it comes as no surprise to find out it’s once again ......yeah Groundhog Day where you just know that it’s gonna be the same oldstory as it was yesterday and will be again tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day and and and and and.......Same old tired lazy excuses same old same old incencere apologies - that’s if they can be bothered to apologise at all  - not that they mean a word of it. Always overcrowded never enough carriages trying to tuck people up for sitting in first class when there’s barely enough room to even sit on the damn roof I mean the service is just beyond awful it’s positively third world...Wait check that so when I when I was in India last time of the trains ran almost on time if I recall?Now then the question that I want to know is where are all those cowardly bigwigs at head office ,the ones that sit around doing nothing except discuss the colour of next weeks boardroom wafers and pinch all our money whilst getting even bigger stomachs from scoffing down corporate lunches washed down with expensive bottles of fine Gin getting sloshed while the rest of suffer from their complete incompetence and lack of empathy towards us? Where are they when the poor old minions have to traipse along the packed out carriages looking for people sitting in first class to nick more hard earned cash from because there’s not enough space to even stand up!They are complete cowards and yellow bellies and haven’t got the guts to face the customers well I for one would like to start a campaign to get rid of these morons and in the meantime I suggest everyone just start some sort of mutiny by sitting in first class at every opportunity and refuse to pay any excess fare fair until either they sort this mess out or better still have the entire contract removed altogether as they are completely incapable of offering any kind of reasonable service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

There was no difference between first class and standard except for a partition between them and standard having comfier Seats. I know this as I couldn’t find first class on my return so sat in standard. No refreshments etc in first so I’m really not sure why I was charged extra. The seats were threadbare, offensive graffiti on the table and seats very thin and hard. Wouldn’t use again	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-01-20T15:48:01Z	Absolutly crap service should be ashamed	Would rate 1 at best. When you took over it was great. Then you did direct trains Liverpool to London. Poor customer service making sale mistakes as predecessors. Turning a train around before last station is a poor show. Shows no regard for customers. Especially when Lime St suggests a train for connection then you leave 30s before its arrival. Sort this out.

2020-01-20T15:48:01Z	what a pile of s**t	This must be the worst performing service I have ever used of any kind. In the past two months I have not been able to complete a single journey to work on time. Either trains are cancelled or woefully late, in both directions. It obviously has caused big problems with work. Historically I have been impressed with the service but it has been completely unacceptable of recent months. Like many others I have no alternative but to use it but would drop it in a heartbeat if given another option. Old rattly, packed, late carriages. Cancellations and/or late trains and the knock on effect that has with connecting (on time) trains from other services has made this completely unreliable. Avoid if possible and make other arrangements...you'll be late for whatever you are going to or coming back from. AWFUL.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-01-20T15:48:01Z	This must be the worst performing…	Shambolic and incompetent. Treat their poor, hard pressed passengers with utter contempt. Delayed, slow, filthy and extortionately expensive. In short, a  disgrace. If it was possible to give zero stars they’d get it as this is what they richly deserve...	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-01-20T15:48:01Z	Awful, just awful	A joke of a company to say the least and overrated with 1 star. Unfortunately have to travel with them every day and it's only going downhill!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-01-20T15:48:01Z	Awful.	I'm impressed with the service offered because trains can go up to 110mph, trains are quiet and peaceful and the bright green livery is nice!! I did not rate it 5 stars because of a few things. 1st class can be rammed, standard class too. The, Old interior of the train could be refurbished (but I have ridden on 350104 and I love the interior as it seems to be the only via London train that has a Destination screen similar to that of newer models I.E Transpennine Express 397s and Northern CAFs. Also love the unique and interesting pole colours as Dark Green [main] and grey [near the doors for Visibility] giving the company a unique sense of character).Another issue is a lack of communication. At Euston, the platform to catch a certain train is not specified. Today I wanted to catch the 1553 Service to Milton Keynes Central. I checked realtimetrains for that, it was meant to arrive on platform 11. When I got on that train however, it decided to do a service to Liverpool Lime Street. Luckily for me, it called at Watford Junction. But the train at Platform 11 should be the service to Milton Keynes Central. This is all due to poor communication of the platforms at Euston and not sticking to the schedule stuck on realtime trains!! That's the only thing i am angry about. Imagine if I went beyond watford Junction to Milton Keynes Central given I'm an oyster card holder.On the plus side, I got 110mph which was impressive and was moderately smooth but could be smoother.To summarise, Great trains, good company but interior and communication could be improved.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-01-20T15:48:01Z	Mix of anger and gratitude	Service is shocking. Always delays cancellations etc. I am on one of their trains while writing this. And the train os just packed yet only 4 coaches when other trains I have been on using this service uave had 12!!! If the service is this busy then maybe this company should be running at least 8 or 12 coach services until at least half 10. Even first class is rammed on this train!!!!!!! Not to mention the train is moving very slowly. Clearly tue infrastructure needs a lot of work doing to it too.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	3
2020-01-20T15:48:01Z	Service is shocking	As so many others have said, this is a total shambles of a company.   Cancelled trains day in, day out, late running, short trains, changes to stopping points and ending points at a moment's notice, horribly overcrowded, they don't deserve to keep their franchise.   Sadly under the current system, we have no choice over the matter for years to come.   I've travelled regularly between Northampton and London for thirty years plus, and things have never been this bad.  Absolute shambles.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-01-20T15:48:01Z	As so many others have said	Deeply unreliable service. Their own stats show 20 percent of their services are cancelled. Half of the rest are late  Primarily due to poor rolling stock and lack of staff. Their complaint system is overrun and usually ignore you. Commuters despair. But this affects peoples lives thru lost jobs and missed school pick ups. Does the company care? No sign of it.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

No refreshments available on my 3 hour journey.  Outgoing train from Euston was on time and arrived slightly late.  The return train was cancelled and I had to wait an hour for the next. However the ticket price was cheap.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	2
2019-12-02T16:47:39Z	The Worst Train service in the UK.	The Worst Train service in the UK.I have travelling in different train lines due to my job purposes and I have never seen any other lines are as bad as this one. The worst i can explain and it's getting worse everyday. Never had a single train on time for last 2 months from Milton keynes central to Watford junction or London euston.The bosses should be fired for this service. They are not worth having to run this service. I always have to travel on the edge due to the work I do and they absolutely ruined for last 3 months. Bloody losers. If you cannot fix this delays or cancellations problem then don't expect us to pay the staggering amount we are paying every months and years. Do things right or leave the office or at least learn from other service providers. It's a shame I have to give them 1 star, I would have given them negative stars if I could.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-12-02T16:47:39Z	Cannot believe how poor this service…	Cannot believe how poor this service has become. I've commuted on this line for over 10 years and it's never been so terrible.Continuous delays, cancellations, staff shortages, broken down /tired old trains, lack of communication. Passengers left incredibly confused, constantly checking multiple apps to see what info you can get. We all pay a huge amount of money per year and it's just unacceptable that this continues. LNR need to take responsibility - the effect on family and work life is unforgivable. Get your act together!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-12-02T16:47:39Z	Ongoing delays and cancellations	Sadly, this train service has gotten very unreliable indeed. Stress each day trying to get to work on time and back home safely at a reasonable hour. Constantly checking 3 Apps to see what state the service is running in until I’ve to attempt to use the train. Please please please could and desperately hope LNR actually produce results from all the promises given about the service supposed to be improving. I’ve used this train route for 12 years. The past two years have been so bad especially since May. Great to link further out of town places to London. But, with such distance, really how was it meant to work properly.. At the very least, one platform change half way so at least some sort of service can keep running. Delays happen, knock on affect of service disruption is inevitable.. It’s bound to be carnage of crowds at stations and packed short length carriage trains.. No trains, no driver available, signals failures, overhead wire problems. Excuse after excuse. Which also makes a miserable journey of a packed train (if it’s running!) and grumpy staff and commuters.. Not having enough drivers for the timetable.. I just don’t understand the logic or common sense. It’s not just daytime commuters who use the service. People do work evenings too!!!This all seems like a lot of box ticking somewhere, rather than sense, reliability and listening to passengers and staff feedback. LNR heads of departments should experience these constant delays then perhaps something might actually be done. Please LNR, help your staff and commuters. It’s quite enough of this bad unreliable service now. Thank you.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-12-02T16:47:39Z	A joke of a rail operator	I use this train company very little, but every time I do I suffer cancellations and delays.

2019-12-02T16:47:39Z	London Northwestern Trains - What a Joke	One of the most expensive lines into London and yet they still charge passengers for a wholly sub-standard service that should be priced at under half of what its charged currently. Delays and cancellations without any communication is a regular thing and empty apologies from a bored train crew. Happy to leave passengers stranded without any alternatives and when the chips are down the ‘we are here to help’ booth at Euston mysteriously disappears. Flaky, fake, money-grabbing, please the shareholders and don’t care about the passengers that pay the fares - this is what London Northwestern care about	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-12-02T16:47:39Z	Delay Cancelled Delay Cancelled Delay	The title is a normal weekly commute. There is no such thing as a train that runs on time for London Northwestern but at least they used to be 3-5 mins late. It’s now an utter disgrace.  Not enough crew members, shortage of carriages, signal failure, trespassers, bird strikes, floods. List goes on but sometimes you won’t even get any information. It’s a bit of hassle but please ensure you always claim compensation - the amount is so measly for the journey stress but at least it makes them somewhat accountable.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

Furthermore, these difficulties appear to be long-standing; whether it is signalling problems, broken down staff and a lack of staff. i find it appalling and absolutely unacceptable that on several occasions, I board my train in Wolverhampton and then I am sitting on my train at Birmingham with no announcements, then someone reads online that my train has been cancelled after about half an hour of waiting.

I have given up, you as a company have broken my faith and lots of other peoples in using public transport. I'm hearing of more and more people returning to using their cars as their regular mode of transport.Amazing to hear radio adverts being played in the Midlands encouraging people to use the train because of having to park in the Birmingham city centre. In all honesty its a lot easier and more convenient then waiting for a train to show whilst stood on a freezing platform, thats if the train isn't cancelled, or being herded around from platform to platform after platform changes at New Street. Maybe the persons involved in creating this radio advert doesn't actually use the trains because it certainly isn't a stress free way of getting in and out of Birmingham. Car for me from now on.

2019-11-13T19:25:58Z	Enough is enough	"I have the misfortune to have been commuting into Euston from Hertfordshire for decades; Since privatisation we have now had Silverlink (bad), London Midland (worse) and now London Northwestern (unbelievably, apparently even worse than its predecessors). London Northwestern (LNW) are however clear winners in the race to the bottom in terms of providing the worst railway service possible; The tickets are amongst the most expensive going and for that price I don't really expect constantly late/delayed/cancelled trains, 4 carriage trains during peak commuter hours into/out of Euston (one of Europe's busiest stations). Dirty, shabby and often unpainted 1980s(?) rolling stock, and ever-changing excuses for their utterly appalling and unreliable service eg ""overhead line damage"".....""trespassers on the track"".....""unavailability of train crews""......"" slow moving freight train""........""disruption due to an earlier incident"" blah, blah, blah.The website is unhelpful when incidents frequently occur and there are rarely any helpful LNW targeted announcements at Euston when regular problems occur.As other reviewers have pointed out the 'delay repay' scheme forces you to enter the same details over and over again to claim a pittance back (you also have to upload an image of your season ticket each time which,of course, already contains all these details......).As with all the other operators there's no one independent (with any teeth) to complain to and letters to the Secretary of State for Transport are met with pointless replies trumpeting the fabulous benefits of privatisation.......I'm old enough to remember British Rail and it's hit and miss efforts but it seems like a golden age of transport in comparison to this utter shambles.Will the government ever show some backbone and put an end to this chaos?"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-11-03T11:21:56Z	Atrocious	Rail service has seen a dramatic decline since LNWR took over franchise from London Midland and replaced modern rolling stock with ancient, uncomfortable, unreliable and shorter trains. Dangerously overcrowded at peak times, compounded by regular cancellations due to breakdowns or staff shortages. Disgraceful!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-11-03T11:21:56Z	Don’t trust them to get you there on time	Cancelled train (Northampton to Euston) - next train so dangerously overcrowded that staff had to stand on the station at Watford to stop passengers getting on.  Every seat and standing space was taken.  If you needed the loo you couldn’t get to it because of the packed aisles.  The first class was given over to everyone to use.  The train took 1 hour 45 minutes to go 80 miles.  The return train was also cancelled and another 1 hour 45 minute train journey taken.  REASON?  Staff shortages.  What a shower Northwestern are.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-11-03T11:21:56Z	This Company is an Absolute Disgrace.	We visit London frequently, either from Birmingham (used LNWR) or from our son’s at Kings Langley. We’ve had problems on three consecutive journeys, including being on a late/slow train to Birmingham where people had to stand all the way. With standing on such long journeys, or even from a Euston to Kings Langley I’m surprised more people aren’t taken I’ll. Such overcrowding is downright dangerous as well as uncomfortable. This company is an absolute disgrace. Paradoxically, the first London North Western Railway which was absorbed into the LMS in 1923 was known as the ‘Premier Line’: not anymore!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-11-03T11:21:56Z	One star is far too generous	Expecting passengers to wait and put up with this service until the new stock arrives in 2020/21 is not good enough. The reasoning for the recent delays is nothing short of comical; whether it be failure in planning of the standard timetable/staff annual leave/blaming freight trains (who are only running slow because they are stuck behind late LNW trains) the list of excuses is endless. You consistently underperform and are not running trains on time.Every morning it's pot luck if I get to work on time, regardless of how early I set off, and my route home now involves a Thameslink to St Albans and a +£20 taxi fare.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-11-03T11:21:56Z	DO NOT USE THIS TRAIN COMPANY...WALKING IS EASIER	I have commuted to London on various train lines over the last 30 years, so feel I have adequate experience to rate this shower of excrement dressed up as a train company. Paying just under £4300 for my season ticket, I expect some form of service, but alas this bunch of clowns take it upon themselves to screw up every single journey I take. Daily delays & cancellations & over the 28/10-1/11/19 period the most horrendous experiences I have EVER witnessed - people sprinting for short form trains, children crying, no staff, no announcements, passengers passing out & Facebook posts that make me realise thousands of people (& their poor families)have been seriously affected. A petition is being raised to Parliament to ask for a review of LNR’s franchise, which is already supported by our local MPs. Here’s hoping their MD’s and Dutch/Japanese owners are forced to hand over to a company that is actually qualified to run trains. Until then I would advise NEVER using this train company as they seem hell bent on affecting the mental health of every single ‘customer’ that dares to utilise their cesspit of a franchise.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

It seems that every week something goes wrong - broken down train, not enough staff, power failures etc. etc. - and you'd think they'd learn and put contingency plans into place but no. Constantly left with no information and no help getting to where you're going. Why put on replacement buses when you can have more and more passengers arriving to stand around on the platform?Even when a service is running (late) the wifi doesn't work, the toilets don't work, the carriages are dirty and there isn't enough of them so there is a fight to get a seat.This week though takes the biscuit and convinced me that what little regard I though they had for passengers doesn't actually exist. Delay repay won't give me back the 10+ hours I have spent standing around stations this week tired, cold, and in pain.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-11-03T11:21:56Z	Game over; stop playing at trains LNR!	The sum total of LNR's knowledge and expertise in and the ability to run a railway service could be comfortably written on a single piece of Lego with room to spare; in fact I suspect the full extent of the company's experience and understanding of rail service management is based solely on a couple of board members' memories of their toy train-playing days. The company has insufficient railway stock, a disenchanted skeleton crew, unrealistic timetables that are in the interests of neither the passengers nor the staff trying to operate them and, worst of all, the company is devoid of empathy for its passengers who on a weekly basis endure overcrowding, cancellations, delays and are frequently required to finance their own journeys home despite having paid full fares to LNR to provide that service to them.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

Staff that simply don’t care. Conductors that don’t keep passengers informed (what *do* they do?). Doors open minutes before departures because ‘useless‘ conductor is needed (?!?) leaving children and the elderly standing in the cold and a scrum for a seat. Regularly no seats free. Often only half-formed trains. Staff shortages. Appalling condition of commuter trains. No contingency planning, customer advice of visible staff when things (often) go wrong. Expensive ticket prices. Recently inflated parking charges at stations. Mechanical breakdowns, regularly! On board facilities terrible and trains filthy. There is nothing good about the execution of this service by its various owners. Epic fail by *appalling* management on all levels. No stars.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-10-31T20:57:53Z	Just NO	The terrible punctuality and cancellation statistics are only part of the story.

We all had such high hopes for LNR. It has systematically become worse by the day. Deteriorating before our eyes with no explanation and no apologies. While the prices continue to rise, the service continues to diminish. It is beyond a joke at this point. There is so much frustration and anger among the commuters. All of it is more than understandable considering the shoddy service we receive. I have taken to driving to Chesham, Luton and Wendover and taking the trains from there to avoid using LNR. Appalling....	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

Which would be more comfortable than sitting on a London North Western Train. I’ve been using the service for 3 years and i’ve seen no improvement to the service. If the are investing in the service then where the fck is the money going.

This week is particularly bad (both my inbound and outbound journeys have been hugely delayed or cancelled every single day) with the high point being the day I spent 1hr45m on a broken down train outside Harrow. The trains themselves are old, cold, inefficient and uncomfortable. The staff have no knowledge and poor communication, the best information comes from Facebook commuter groups. I can't believe they'll even attempt to justify putting their already extortionate prices up still further in January given the terrible service they provide, but I have no doubt that they will.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-10-31T20:57:53Z	London Northwestern Railway is a shambles	Ever since May the trains to and from Euston through Berkhamsted have been regularly late or cancelled. The number of carriages that used to be available during peak times has been drastically reduced and the trains that do arrive are rickety old stock that lack heating, air conditioning or comfort of any kind. Responses to complaints are weasel-worded non-apologies, with not a sniff of responsibility for the shambles they've turned this train line into. And then they have the gall to raise prices and claim they're providing an excellent service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-10-31T20:57:53Z	Generally unreliable, overpriced and tatty	It is my misfortune to have to use LNW to commute from my hometown to work in London (the misfortune being slightly mitigated by working part time). At the moment, trains are late or cancelled every day, a lot of the rolling stock consists of old carriages which are dirty and uncomfortable. I don’t blame LNW for delays/cancellations which are due to incidents outside their control (suicides, cable theft, trees down and similar) but I do blame them for inflicting misery on us when they introduced the new timetable in May 19 which was a fiasco (4 carriage trains in the rush hour), the crappy carriages, the constant running-late (practically every day but usually under 15 minutes so one can’t claim delay repay) and yet raising the ticket prices year on year. If I have to travel in a carriage from 1980, I’d like to pay the ticket price from 1980 - because they’re not an improvement that I would (gladly) pay for, they’re a deterioration and therefore should cost me less! LNW could do soooooo much better!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

Being told that I need to find an alternative route to my destination incurs additional expense on top of the money that I have already paid to park my car at my local station. The consistent delays and expense are causing untold stress - I enjoy my job but fear that I am going to have to pack it in due to the fact that the commuting and extra expense is making me ill - I am letting clients down and cancelling too many meetings and appointments  due to the fact that this company is failing in its contractual obligations and completely disregarding the needs of seasoned commuters like myself.

These guys couldn’t organise a drinking session at a free bar. They are so inept, that I trust Mr blobby more. I feel sorry for the staff, to work for the worst train line in history. The commuters deserve better, we pay extortionate fares, cramped conditions and have to deal with their shocking service each  and everyday. The day cannot come quick enough when the government take back ownership of this shocking organisation.

I commute to and from London with this company 5 days a week and I could probably count on one hand the number of times my train has been on time. The past week has been absolutely horrific with daily 2+ hour delays every single day without fail, cancellation of all trains out of Euston for hours on end and the only advice being ""take an alternative route"" - believe me if I had an alternative route I would take it every single day!! But luckily for this company it runs the only route available for thousands of people so it has no incentive to improve its terrible terrible services. Packed commuter trains will be regularly cut down from 12 carriages to 4 carriages for no reason. LNWR will claim they are ""using all carriages available to them"" so I guess train carriages must frequently just go missing overnight. Last night was complete carnage with stampedes of people trying to get down to the platform each time a train was actually announced as running, with the majority of people being sent back as the train was already full, for the long wait to see if they were ever going to be able to get a train home. But don't worry, delay repay with give you £2.50 back 2 weeks later, if you can be bothered to fill out the long tedious form each time."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-10-30T07:13:18Z	Daily long delays and cancellations at…	Daily long delays and cancellations at any hour for the past month between Bham and London Euston. Excuses range from lack of crew members to signalling problems to broken down trains to congestion... It really makes no difference to customers anymore what reasons they come up with. Fact is I pay £553.00 per month for my season ticket and get no service at all. Several times, including today, train service completely stopped at Northampton and customers are left stranded. It took me 7 hours today to get home when it should have taken less than 2 hours. It is seriously impacting my private life as well as my work.I want to know what measures LNW are putting into place to provide a NORMAL service. I don't want anything special, just trains that run, sometimes even on time.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

At least Southern run once an hour to Shepherd's Bush where you can change to the Central Line.  LNWR do not deserve a one star rating. Their service is absolutely atrocious.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-10-30T07:13:18Z	A consistently atrocious service	"Since London Northwestern took over the Euston to New Street franchise, the level of service has been absolutely appalling. Rush hour trains are delayed or cancelled every single day, to the extent that I can't remember the last time one of my usual commuter trains left the station on time. When trains do run, they're often so overcrowded that many people aren't able to board them. Delays and cancellations aren't announced until the last minute, often leaving hundreds of passengers waiting on a platform for an indefinitely ""delayed"" train for over an hour, only for it to then be cancelled with no explanation.I'm consistently late for work (despite leaving the house with almost 2 hours to spare) and consistently late enough home that I miss my daughter's bed time. The thought of them continuing to hold this franchise until 2026 is completely unacceptable."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-10-30T07:13:18Z	How much more pathetic can you get	How much more pathetic can you get? Everytime we think you couldn't do any worse, you manage to surprise us. The trains were delayed then a few cancelled, then announced it was arriving in 2 mins and then only to be cancelled again. What do you think of customers? If you think we're a joke, then look really hard at yourselves. The staff at the harrow and wealdstone station are worse. No one to own up or even apologise for whatever it is that was going on today. No one to explain and they are mere statues and audience to the stupidity that was unfolding the the station. Every darn train gets cancelled after showing signs of hope. I stood there being dumbfounded with 200 others on the platform whilst being misguided by the announcements at the station. I can't imagine the number of important meetings, hospital appointments, interviews that you've caused people today. Shame on you and your service! Either redeem yourself and just go down under. Why be a burden to passengers who've paid overly priced tickets for your substandard service?!?!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-10-30T07:13:18Z	Don't do it!	Don't do it!I thought I had a bargain ticket from Liverpool to London, First Class, really cheap.  The carriage is an absolute cowshed - freezing cold, ancient and smells funny. I've also just learned that in the entire four hour journey, in the middle of a weekday, there's no trolley service whatsoever, not even tea and biscuits 😂I would've been better off in standard class on any other service, this is absolute rubbish!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-10-30T07:13:18Z	Cattle Class Carnage !!!	I commute on these trains daily into and from Birmingham. The service is utterly appalling. Birmingham is second largest city in the country and yet this inept train service serves destinations with 4 carriage trains during rush hour in the morning and the evening.The platforms are heaving with passengers and are 7 to 8 people deep. When the train arrives ( which is never on time) there is complete and utter carnage to get on the trains due to insufficient provision of carriages.  Passengers are packed in like cattle up and down the train aisles and crammed into the carriage entrance areas. When the train stops at a station, hoards of people have to get off and back on the train to let a passenger disembark the train !  This is simply appalling, Passengers who have suitcases and pushchairs are trapped amongst the myriad of people who packed themselves onto the trains. We are treated worse than animals, as animals have more room to move on an animal transporter.The trains are continually late or cancelled. Last Friday and today my train was late, so they cancelled all the local stops before Coventry. Outrageous ! Therefore hundreds of people were faced to wait a further 40 minutes for the next train. When the 4 carriage train arrived, there were so many passengers half of them couldn't get on the train.Does not the railway realise the impact that this has on peoples lives ???? I have children to collect and have had to pay extra fees from the school club due to late arrival.A colleague of mine, has received a verbal warning from work due to being late. This was caused by the 7.40am train being consistently cancelled.How can the government justify spending billions on HS2 when all the regional railways are in a complete state of disrepair, cant run on time and are continually cancelled. The railway cant even provide sufficient carriage when on the off occasion the trains actually run on time.We should be receiving a significant rebate from London Northwestern for the disruption it causes to peoples lives.  I for one, am absolutely furious that I have to endure the chaos, extremely poor service and ultimately being treated worse than a farm animal !!!!Its not rocket science to schedule trains with sufficient capacity for the commuters that use the service. One has to question the muppets that are currently managing this service, as Kermit the frog could no doubt do a better job !!!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

No thought gone into new route of Rugeley Trent Valley to London Euston v.v. lack of care and lack of service. My advice is not to buy a train ticket as conductors are too embarrassed to come down the carriage and ask to see your tickets, for fear of abuse. London Northwestern. Wake up and provide a service or get out.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-10-30T07:13:18Z	Terrible, unreliable, seem to be getting worst…	This company by far the worst to have operated this franchise. I am forced to commute daily on these trains and there lack of reliability impacts my work and home life.  They never run on time and keep getting cancelled. I have been informed by staff that they rely on overtime to run the service but staff do not want to work overtime due to extended hours of work. Not an operating model for a public service surely. Their communication is terrible, information provided is never consistent.  They also seem to be using old train carriages that are warn out.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-10-30T07:13:18Z	cattle class, no operational toilets	Usually travel from Liverpool to Euston on virgin and booking London north western was a mistake - in many ways. Fortunately after making the booking I read the reviews and prepared for the journey with a good supply of drinks and snacks. Unfortunately I wasn’t prepared for the absence of toilet facilities - Yes you read that correctly, on a 4 hour journey from Euston to Liverpool all of the toilets were out of order.Apart from the initial apology as we left Euston there was no further update, no train staff availability, no explanation of why you would run an 8 coach train from one end of the country to the other without a single working toilet. A shambles and a disgrace. Overcrowded cattle class. Do not use this service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

Affordable, reliable (for the most part), good customer service and comfortable trains.

2019-10-30T07:13:18Z	Increasingly dreadful	Increasingly dreadful. Thought at first they were ok, but now  often late and cancelled, often because of lack of train crew. When seriously delayed they then miss out local stations like mine, sometimes 2 in a row, so instead of a train at 10.40 there isn’t one prepared to stop till 11.40.  Have been sat at New Street for 25 minutes waiting to leave - no explanation whatsoever of what the delay is. Possibly even worse than London Midland.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-10-30T07:13:18Z	WORST train service in the country	Trains from Watford to Euston in the morning (specifically 7:32-7:46) peak time are ALWAYS late. Often trains are delayed in the evening from Euston. It’s a disgrace. Every day I’m late for work. Extreme overcrowding on these daily delays. Never get a seat. Often reduced number of carriages causing overcrowding. Often lame excuses like the train is late due to driver being late- basic stuff. Pay them a huge chunk of my salary only to go into work late and stressed. I’ll be spreading the word of you being the worst train service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

I have regular used the old London Midland to go from Liverpool to Birmingham without an issue.Since the Liverpool to London train has come in it's been complete chaos. I've had a train-full of people pushed off by staff and told the next train wasn't for 30 minutes (this one was cancelled) only for a completely full Liverpool service to pull out the station as we got off!I pity the car less who have to put up with this awful service.

2019-09-19T14:56:47Z	Refund Approved but not Received	I recently booked a super off-peak single ticket from Crewe to Euston and boarded the train about 15 minutes late. When we reached Coventry the guard told us that the train was now only going to Northampton, and passengers for stations to Euston would have to transfer to another (unspecified) train.Well, when we got to Rugby the train was over an hour late, due to area-wide signalling problems, so I hopped off the LNWR train and onto a Virgin train that was waiting for clearance to depart for Euston. The bottom line is that I got to London well over an hour late and made a claim to LNWR for a refund, which they quickly approved. All good, you may think, but no, the refund never arrived. LNWR claimed that they had paid it back to my credit card, but the bank had rejected the transaction. The bank says they have never seen it, but have agreed to refund me the fare following a dispute I raised.Seems to me that LNWR might not be particularly competent or, dare one, say honest when it comes to processing refunds.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

This service has got worse since the recent changes and poor planning of rolling stock to try and save money but give the impression of more carriages and better service. Complete tripe. Appalling customer service because when the service is terminated you have a 2% chance that LNW will have arranged onward transport.

2019-09-19T14:56:47Z	Not so bad on the right line....	Many reviewers are talking about different lines run by this company. On the London Euston - Crewe line, carriages are air conditioned, usually comfortable, and sometimes if your lucky the WI-FI works. I've had delays, however they have a delay repay scheme available through their app. It's little compensation but not bad.There are very informative on the trains and keep you updated whilst standing at signals etc. Some of the train managers keep you entertained over the PA. They are all after getting on BGT!When there was a signal failure at Euston, they laid on an emergency train. This was uncomfortable, old and grubby. Maybe this is the rolling stock people are talking about.The London Euston to Crewe still seems to be the busiest ever with platform numbers being announced at the last two minutes there is a stampede you have to join, peak times and off peak times.... Literally when LNR fast service platform is announced going from Euston to Crewe, the station almost empties!So in summary, different lines have different standards/rolling stock it would seem. My home station master very helpful. It's nice to read the quote of the day, comments board when going through to the platform.They do always have a mobile desk at Euston, and so in my opinion offer good customer service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	3

I cannot comprehend how they can actually be this incompetent. Changing the Liverpool Lime Street service from Birmingham New Street to London Euston has been an absolute disaster with clearly so much more scope for things to go wrong on such a long route with a ridiculous number of stops. I’m now in the position of looking for alternative employment because this service that costs me £3k per year is not fit for purpose.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-09-19T14:56:47Z	An absolute farce !	So, London Northwestern railway decide to cancel without notice my wife's Saturday evening 19.33. train from Euston to Lichfield meaning that she and many others have to wait  almost two hours for the next overcrowded train. What had been a good leisure day rapidly dissolved. So plenty of time to obtain the claim form which says that a full refund is due. It was duly  completed and posted. Several weeks later we received a letter from the aptly named 'delay repay' team stating that I had not replied to their e-mail - which I had never received. On phoning them , they couldn't locate their e-mail and didn't seem to have any idea why I  had received the letter, nor why my credit card couldn't be refunded .To try and be brief, after five phone calls (you have to wait at least 15 minutes for somebody to pick up), and after getting confirmation that the claim was justified , none of the contacts could actually action a refund on my credit card nor through their suggested alternative, a  BACS transfer despite having been told twice that this would be actioned immediately . In total there were five calls and four contacts all giving varying versions of what was going to happen . Well a week later I'm still waiting ,but I suppose its low priority claim being under £20. Rest assured LNR that I won't be bothering you again on the phone or on your trains. You should be ashamed of running your business like this and don't deserve to have your contract.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

Every day for the past months I have been delayed, inconvenienced, not been able to get on to short formed trains or stood on overcrowded trains in conditions that would be illegal to transport animals in.  Their justification for messing up the journeys was to provide more coaches for their new Watford to Euston service - this feels at the expense of those who have longer journeys and who pay more.

I travel to euston everyday and all I see is a load of the same staff standing around chatting, having a laugh and doing nothing useful. When all the trains are delayed and they may have to do some work they magically vanish. Met one of the alleged senior managers / head clown at one of their drop in clinics. General negative attitude and lack of accountability. Very much a things just go wrong mindset. He couldn’t provide any suggestion or evidence of remedial plans nor sensible suggestion of why their delay repay system is so useless and puts the onus on the traveller, rather than the business that has let the paying traveller down.

My average daily commute has gone from 1.5 hours to 2 and it’s not acceptable. I’ve witnessed bullying behaviour from staff - even turning physical once towards customers.

There are only 4 carriages and the train was very overcrowded. 4 carriages and going all the way to Liverpool Lime Street. The only saving grace was that the train actually stops for 10 minutes at Northampton so I could buy some water.

2019-07-31T17:16:06Z	Shocking service and overpriced	We booked a 19.15 from Euston to Birmingham New Street on 12th July by accident thinking it was a Virgin Trains service (because it was the same price) but stuck with it once we'd realised. Big mistake. As other reviews say, the trains are dirty and overcrowded. The 'First Class' service we booked was non-existent: the chairs and tables are identical to those in the other carriages and of course there is no food or drink service - you don't even get an assigned seat, which makes it possible you won't get a seat at all. Worst of all, though, there was no staff presence in the carriages at all. No tickets were checked and nobody was present to deal with noise (which did give rise to argument in the next carriage) or emergencies. The Wifi is unreliable. The train splits at Birmingham and each half of the train goes in a different direction but as the carriages have no letters on the inside there was confusion as to which carriages were going where, and no staff member to ask. The only employee on the train (apart, presumably, from the driver) was to be found locked in a dark cabin between two carriages. When asked whether he checked tickets, he smiled and shrugged his shoulders. 'Sometimes' he joked. 'Do you want to buy one?' He later skulked through the carriages but did not speak to a single customer. No checks for payment were made at Euston or New Street so it appears payment on LNW is effectively voluntary. I assume the government subsidies (our money, of course) to the new company make them relaxed about collecting other revenue from customers. For the same price on Virgin you get an assigned seat with lots of room in a clean carriage, complimentary food and drink brought to your table, the Wifi sometimes works and, of course, you get there half an hour quicker. You could use LNS as it's probably free - but I'm not even sure it's worth that price.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-07-31T17:16:06Z	Literally a waste of money	Everything people have said in the one star reviews is true. Very severe overcrowding with absolutely definite accompanying Health and Safety issues including opening the doors on a train which was overcrowded to Japanese subway levels thereby encouraging even more people to try to cram on board. Any cattle transporter in this country would be closed down legally if they treated cattle like this. When I had the temerity to comment on this I was aggressively pursued up the station ramp walking backwards by an 'employee' who really looked as if he wanted a fight - have a look on the CCTV LNT - it's there! I repeatedly asked this person why he was pursuing me and eventually he stopped telling me that I was barred from travelling. Many justifiably angry customers, 30-40 I would say, were demanding to see a manager but none ever appeared despite the situation. A girl with crutches was crying at the barrier as she had a severe back problem - she was whisked away in the end LNT doubtlessly fearing for their public image . Replacement buses were produced in the end. I waited til the morning as I had paid for a train ticket and I expect to travel by train.NEVER,EVER AGAIN. It's Virgin (god help us all) or the coach from now on. Never had such problems with London Midland. Oh and don't recruit thugs who hide behind British Transport Police staff.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-07-31T17:16:06Z	A total, utter and complete disgrace.	The WORST public transport service I have EVER experienced in my life (and I've lived in other countries, including less developed than UK!) Is it possible to claim refunds 4 days a week for cancellations? Is it possible to still have a paper ticket that WON'T EVER work in tfl machines even if you change it every week? (And be told off by TFL staff because you haven't changed it)?With Northwestern Railway ANYTHING you can possibly imagine is possible trust me!! Come rain or shine, they will offer you the WORST SERVICE for the reasonable price of £4k a year!!!!This should be a national scandal but nobody is doing anything!!!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-07-31T17:16:06Z	The WORST public transport service I…	This company needs serious revaluation it is always late and never leaves the station on time, for last 3 weeks 1633 train from London Euston to Tring has been late and the service is really busy and people are packed like sardines, as a paying customer this is frustrating as I am paying for a service which i am not receiving!!!! and not sure why it hasnt been flagged up with health and safety as ive seen 2 people collapse in last 2 weeks on this train!!!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-07-31T17:16:06Z	This company needs serious revaluation…	I wish there was a 0 rating, even a minus score would be more appropriate than 0. This is a horrendous train company which I will never use again and I advise you to do the same. Travelling back to Birmingham form London Euston yesterday, the train stopped multiple times and when moving was at a snails pace. When we reached the Northampton stop around midway through the planned journey the train was cancelled with no explanation. At which time we were told by the conductor a replacement train would be waiting on platform 2. But the train we were on stopped at platform 2, causing confusion for the hundreds of people getting off. Around 10 minutes later an announcement was made that we would now board a train on platform 3 with another 20 minute delay. Once this train arrived everyone boarded but the train did not depart. After another 5 minutes of waiting for the train to move the conductor of that train announced that that train was canceled and we would have another one to catch on platform 2 nine minutes time from then. So everyone got off and boarded the train at platform 2, which happened to be the original train we were all on that hadn't gone anywhere. But once we boarded the train and announcement was made that the train would instead be going back to London Euston and another train would come for us in another 20ish minutes. When this train finally came, the conductor announced that only the rear 4 coaches would be going with the other ones being decoupled and moved to a depot. This caused mass overcrowding with the train being jam-packed on a Saturday, with family's with little children having to suffer in the 33 celsius heat. Added to this the conductor announced the toilets weren't working and that we didn't have a driver, as he was stuck on another train that wouldn't be there for another 20 minutes. In all fairness this conductor was the most patient and nicest guy in the world, the only one to answer anyone's questions and offer help, who was thrown in the deep-end, he deserves a raise and a bonus. So all in all we experienced a 70+ minute delay on the hottest day of the year where hundreds of people were moved from train to train without going anywhere multiple times. This was also at the end of the day so people who had to get connecting trains to further destinations had no more timetabled trains available to catch.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-07-31T17:16:06Z	I wish there was a 0 rating: HORRENDOUS TRAIN COMPANY!!!	Appalling. When they took over from London Midland the carriages stock went downhill rapidly. Shorter formations mean overcrowding in woefully outdated carriages that seem like they’ve been to ‘nam and back. Nothing short of disgraceful. Did they sell them off for a quick buck? Unbelievably bad. Especially for just shy of £400/month. The UK should be embarrassed to have operators like this forming the backbone of commuter travel in and out of the capital from the north west. London midland, please come back. All is forgiven.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-07-31T17:16:06Z	Appalling	Hollow boasting about the brilliance of their service does not match the reality. Cancellations and delays every week, cannot even run a very limited service on a major route at peak times (Euston to Crewe). Pitiful.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-07-31T17:16:06Z	Hollow boasting about the brilliance of…	Finally got out of Crewe! 😅 After two cancelled trains and a missing driver, me and my girlfriend finally departed on the third delayed train to London Euston. No representative from London Northwest Railway was here to help people with their concerns and direct them to the right trains. No apology from the driver or any information was passed our way. The cheap tickets are no saving grace to this abysmal service. So if you’re thinking about your wallet and considering traveling with London Northwestern Railway - save those quids and travel with someone else.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-07-31T17:16:06Z	Third time lucky?	Frequent service between London and Milton Keynes and journey times are good on faster trains. Free WiFi on board. However fares are not cheap unless you travel off peak and the ride quality of the trains is abysmal. At times it feels more like riding a roller coaster than a train. The trains also feel rather shabby with ripped and torn cushions, awful brown deposits on seat cushions and sticky carpets. Some of the trains have dreadful 3+2 seating which results in people half sitting in aisles as people try to cram into seating designed for people sized like toddlers and making it painful to use the gangways.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-07-31T17:16:06Z	Frequent service between London and…	For a year and a half and for two hours a day I have endured this glorified cattle truck.There is no aircon, so in the warmer months we swelter in the filthy (rush hour trains are frequently dirty and are not cleaned) slow moving carriages. The seats are about as uncomfortable as it is possible to make them, they are cramped (especially when you get three in a row) and often the trains are short (4 carriages, rather than 8) and you can't even sit on the uncomfortable chairs! You get to work hot and tired with it all to look forward to again in the evening. Remind me again, why do we pay £150 a week for this?! Look at the other reviews and overall ratings here, if this was a normal business it wouldn't still exist! Will it ever change? ... probably not!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	2
2019-07-31T17:16:06Z	A cattletruck would be an upgrade!	The introduction of the new timetable in May has been a disaster for commuters. From Kings Langley we now get old rolling stock with no air conditioning, many more cancellations( some trains being cancelled within 4 minutes of departure) shorter trains at peak times which you cannot even board. And for this we are paying more and more. The rail regulator should act now to reverse the last fare increase and ban LNWR from imposing any more fare increases until its service markedly improves.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-07-31T17:16:06Z	LNWR Disgrace	I pay £4400 a year to travel from kings Langley to central London.Since the new timetable was introduced a few weeks ago, trains are continuously cancelled, now always late and the trains that do show up are shorter and dangerously overcrowded.I emailed London northwestern. No response , even when paying so much money. What will it take ? A death with the overcrowding ? As long as London northwestern profit from commuters who have no choice other than to use their services then they are happy.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-07-31T17:16:06Z	The worst service possible	Today my friend and I had to get a different train from our friends as the door closed and we were not allowed to join our party as the doors could not open bare in mind we were not late for our train we were delayed and waiting on the platform for this train. My friend and I were on the Aberdeen train from Newcastle we had to stand at the doors as there was no space for us we were are two young women who were talking about our night we had for our friends surprise birthday party night out so yes we were laughing and talking but not to the point we were being rude just two girls laughing and chatting then this “man” barged up to us screaming at us to shut up and disappear and pointing his fingers waving us away and when I say he was screaming at us I am not over exaggerating this. It came to light that we were standing at the quiet lounge which I can assure you my friend and I did not know was there and were not being disrespectful enough to be spoken to this way.Your employe was present at the time with the snack trolley and he told her to have a word with us she then asked us to move down the carriage after being completely embarrassed and verbally abused by this stranger I asked this member of staff if she felt it was acceptable for this “man” to shout at us like that to my absolute shock she turned around and shouted at me saying “yes you deserved it” o cannot believe how we were treated if the man had came up to us and asked us to be quiet in a calm way and explained about the quiet Lounge I’d have apologised and moved on again we were not meaning to cause any upset but I’d say there was more upset caused to my self and my friedTo the point I was brought to tears and feltCompletely unsafe as this man was extremely aggressive and your staff could care less totally disgusting and this member of staff should be ashamed of her self to let someone speak to a other person this way!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-06-01T07:32:56Z	Used this company to travel down from…	Used this company to travel down from Crewe to Euston on 27th may to attend the Aston Villa versus Derby County playoff final at Wembley. As the service started at Crewe we easily got a seat, by Lichfield the train was full to overflowing, with many people left on the platform. When we arrived at Tamworth no one was allowed to board the train ,as was the case for every other station on the route.The one positive was the lady conductor who couldn't be more apologetic.We had pre booked the 2027 return. I'm surprised that no one was killed in the rush for this train,the train was standing room only,so we aborted this service and went to the ticket to purchase tickets for the Virgin service to Preston which was calling at Stafford and Crewe. We then heard over the tannoy , that Virgin were accepting northwestern tickets on this service, I would not use this company again if it was FREE.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-06-01T07:32:56Z	Awful experience- no organisation	Awful experience. 4 carriages arrived and over 500 people waiting. A full train turns up at 8 o'clock (which we booked for) however it was impossible to even get a single person on. This meant that 500 people were stranded on the platform waiting for the next train at 9.01. This again was full with people squashed in it meaning the 500 people plus the people who booked the 9 o'clock train could not get on! In the end we got on a train at around 9.40 and that was a Virgin one because we got told to go on that. It was a very poorly organised and i felt sorry for the woman on the platform that had to deal with the angry customers. I don't think they should be taking people's money for specific times when they are clearly not bothered about people getting on their specific train to get to a destination at a specific time. I am angry because we wanted to make a day of it in London but instead had to get there late and not do what we wanted to!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-06-01T07:32:56Z	A human disaster waiting to happen.	If I could have left zero I would. Travel to and from Wembley was beyond a joke. For a significant match day and on what was probably going to be the busiest route (via Watford) putting on 4 carriages is quite frankly ridiculous. Luckily for the outbound route, we were lucky to get on earlier but by the time we reached Tring (still 6 stops to go) the train was dangerously full. Returning was no better, no northbound main line trains (on a matchday from the national stadium - REALLY!!). We had to get a tube to harrow & wealdstone which is where the chaos really started. There were no marshalls at the station resulting in it being a complete free for all and push to get on any train. To my complete shock, the first train arrived with only 4 carriages. People getting on were pushing and being dangerously crushed.I could hear people screaming to stop and there were children being hurt. The next train arrived with the same consequences (and only 4 carriages!!!). Myself and my son were pushed and shoved trying to get on to the train. At one point I thought I had lost him with the surge of people pushing each other attempting to get on the train. On board we were severely crushed until most left at Watford. The people running this company should be investigated and reported. You simply cannot operate a service with such neglect, it's a human disaster waiting to happen.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

So the Greater Anglia call centre person who could barely speak recognisable English, gave me the  correct number, only it wasn't - she gave me the number for TFL!!

At least 3 times per week trains are delayed, cancelled or often run on time and just stop for up to 10 minutes with no explanation. I know it sounds petty but when I am doing 12 hour days all I want to do is get home at a reasonable time. Every time it is due to trespassers on the track, why does it take so long to get back to normal? Why do they not have better safeguards and why do all the other trains seem to run without delay? I know there are worse services than this but its so predictable and the excuses never seem justified to the price I pay. I would strongly recommend anyone thinking of travelling with this provider to think again or drive if they can. Avoid at all possible costs, I only travel because I have to, and I am trying to get out of London so I do not have to pay these fee's for such terrible service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-01-07T06:40:13Z	Euston is closure 2nd September	London Euston is closed on the 2nd September which happens to land on the dates I am travelling; this was seemingly not the case when I booked the ticket as it was booked on the 14th June 2018, less than 12 weeks before when the advance tickets are released. The alternative offered was via a bus route which would get me to London Stanmore at gone 2pm; this would mean after the tube journey I would get to central London over 3 hours later than I was supposed to. This is completely unacceptable as I have things planned in London that day (a Theatre show at 3pm). All you were offering was a refund which again is unacceptable as now it will cost me double what I paid for the tickets to find a viable route into London in a reasonable amount of time. Very poor way of handling a situation, another train provider should have been made available to get customers to their location on time. This treatment of customers has not been thought through or planned in any way to satisfy the customer only the company.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

Constant delays, being forced to take different routes when trains are cancelled or delayed indefinitely and then pay for those fares on top of the original purchase, rude and disrespectful staff, and unhygienic conditions. If I had the option to catapault myself to work then I would, but unfortunately I have to bear the misery this company gives me each and every morning. Did I mention they’re putting fare prices up again? 300% increase in fare prices since the National Rail was privatised, and what have we got to show for it?	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-01-07T06:40:13Z	A constantly stressful experience	Commuting with London Northwestern has been the most miserable experience of my working life so far. The stress of never knowing whether you will arrive where you need to be on time, and be able to get home again has at times driven me to the verge of tears. Delay repay doesn't make up for this experience.

Next time I'll drive to the nearest underground stop.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-01-07T06:40:13Z	Poor facilities	Unfortunately, after this new company took over London Midland no customer surveys or other type of research were conducted. Service issues are the same. For instance, condition of the toilets - smelly, dirty and not fit for use by small children, no belts on the baby change tables, no tissues and no hot water.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1
2018-05-24T08:24:18Z	Extremely poor	Extremely poor. How they have been given the contract by the government is beyond me.

Easily the worst operator on the west coast main line. If you are forced to use lnwrailway then you are in for a sorry experience. This is the company that formed in the wake of London midlands demise, but it is the same staff and the same trains, with the same awful experience. Operators like this gives the railway a bad name.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

My only conclusion is the site just wants you to give up and go away .In short don't waste your time just visit local train station and get refund via good old pen and paper.Its free post and just a form which according to website can be  obtained  from local train station .I wasted over two hours ."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

I was travelling from Runcorn to Liverpool which is a whopping £7.50 return for a 10 minute journey. I only had cash to pay with which the machines don’t take and there was no one at the stands. My wife and I were fined £20 each when we arrived at the station by goons in a uniform. I had cash out ready to pay when the thug approached me attempting to intimidate me with his tone of voice.

Shocking was told not to worry about getting a refund or re booking for a later date by various modes of contact telephone, twitter and email prior to the date of my travel which needed to be cancelled due to the covid 19 virus. I couldn't do it online without paying the normal charge of £8 per ticket but upon stating why were they keeping this charge when all the other operators I checked were waiving the penalty fees due to the virus and offering people the chance to rebook or get a full refund. They suggested I send a ticket query and not to worry it would be sorted. Well last time I listen to your customer service as was told I could get no refund and as date of travel had passed nothing they could do. Ended up going round in circles so have taken this to the Rail Ombudsman cannot state how poor they have been at every level and obviously profiteering out of this national emergency I will never be using these jokers again!!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.londonnorthwesternrailway.co.uk	1

2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Actually a good train line!	You know what despite some bad feedback on here I actually really like southeastern, they rarely have train disputation IE:works on the Trainline and when they do they give you plenty of notice and make it clear.....by putting up posters at stations, all over Twitter and other social media so you have enough time to make other arrangements. I have found that when something happens like signal fault or someone on the tracks they are quick to resolve the problem and bring service back to normal......I use south south eastern everyday to get to and from work at peak and non peak hours including really early trains and late trains and I rarely have problems with them. Compared to other train networks like great northern and southern that are absolutely shambolic with daily delays, daily issues on the train lines, cancelled trains last minute I actually can’t fault southeastern.  For people complaining about timetables if your a frequent southeastern customer you should know by now they change to summer and autumn time tables and should be checking before you travel train times to avoid issues and give yourself enough time to get to the station and wait! It’s abit of common sense, throughout covid trains were still running at a reasonable service not as frequent As I would like but frequent enough and for people like me that are key workers working throughout covid this was excellent and a life saver, saving me from tubing and getting several busses, I just checked trains before I travel and made sure I knew the train times. I have been travelling on south eastern for around 5 years now and genuinely can not fault the company compared to other appalling ones I’ve experienced.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	4

As of 7th of September they introduced a new timetable,which they claim would run 98% of pre-COVID trains. This is an absolute lie and they know it. In reality they have cut 50% of rush hour trains from my station (Chelsfield),removed all fast services and left only one direct to Charing Cross. They make us do multiple changes of stations and trains ,exposing us to COVID at a greater rate. Their replies are pointless and you can clearly feel they are just annoyed and want you to disappear. Obviously there is no alternative and we have to use this horrible company which makes it even more frustrating	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1

I received the reply on the same date and was offered the refund. After I replied back that I want to get the refund. I received the confirmation of the refund straight away. The email was written so politely. I am very pleased and would recommend if you have a problem, try to contact them. I went to their website and fill in the contact us form with few screens shot of my tickets and the evidences why i cannot travel.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	5

Unsafe and irresponsible. People rely on this utter disgrace of a service and just to get disappointed again and again. Unfortunately they take advantage of people having no other choice and are unlikely to change their ways. Aside from this, the price they charge is astronomical and it’s disgusting considering the condition most trains on the London line are in.

2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Unreliable, greedy and overall poor excuse of a railway operator	I have been forced to use Southeastern Railway for years had have nearly nothing positive to say. They know that commuters rely on their service so hike the prices up but can't even provide a decent service.The only reliable thing about southeastern is that you know your train will either be late or cancelled without any notice.To top it off, if you dare ask for compensation they will offer peanuts in return. For example, i paid about 25 quid for a return from London to Rochester, the last couple trains were cancelled so we were unable to get home. Had to stay at a friend's house and pay for another ticket the next day so already out of pocket. How much compensation did i get? About 5 pounds.They don't care about their passengers and are useless.

They’ll happily cancel all trains beyond a station at the drop of a hat and then make zero effort to arrange busses or alternatives, their boards will not indicate the cancellations, then you see their lazy staff mucking about and reading the paper rather than informing customers. They are playing on COVID to be even lazier, we’re all back at work (some of us are critical workers so had to be) so run a proper service and stop conning us out of money.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1

I think it is outrageous how your own website states that we as customers should be wearing face coverings on your transport systems. However- none of your staff are? Upon mentioning this to one of the station staff, they told me that Southeastern are refusing to let their staff wear face masks or coverings.

2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Absolutely terrible customer service	Both my husband and I pay around £2,600 each for an annual ticket and have done so for over 10 years.One of our tickets did not expire until May 2020 and we have not been able to use it from March due to the COVID 19 situation.  Submitted the refund claim as per the website and receive a reply to say.... we understand the testing times and current difficult situation etc but after our administration fee, you refund due is £2. That won't even buy a single ticket to the next station on our train line. Personally I would be embarrassed to have to write that email to a customer! It would be much more helpful to credit the remaining duration on this ticket, on to the next season ticket we buy.  The situation is also beyond our control and we are not simply choosing to avoid travelling to work, it's the recommendation for everyone's safety. Would be nice to factor a bit of common sense in to the process.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1

2020-03-14T18:22:24Z	Southeastern railway services are oblivious to problems no doubt	Southeastern railway services are appalling considering the amount you pay for the service. Trains are not cheap it’s just as expensive to run a car with what luxuries? You don’t get to places on time, trains bloody stink and filthy, no staff on platforms especially places like Slade green and Erith which makes it harder for people that don’t know how the system works and not to mention, when there is a delay you know 30+ minutes later and you’re already late. When you’ve paid £300 a month for a season ticket to be late every other day it’s frustrating & annoying.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-03-14T18:22:24Z	Terrible service ,delays every day	New week, no change. Stuck outside London Bridge and the train arrived and left a minute early from the destination. South Eastern get worse and worse as the weeks go on, as stated by many on here the worst Trainline in the country. Please remove this railway from under private control, it is a shambles.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-03-14T18:22:24Z	New week	The Southeastern trains from/to Dartford and Slade Green are absolutely disgusting. The trains are filthy from inside, the arrangement of the seats is uncomfortable, the seats are dirty and it doesn't look like the trains are ever cleaned. Frequently there is awful smell coming from the toilet. The trains are rarely on time, delay repay takes forever to process and is very little in comparison to the inconvenience caused from the delays. Some trains arrive with 6-8 coaches in peak times, which is not enough to accommodate the amount of people who need to get to work/home. The ventilation on these trains is rubbish.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-03-14T18:22:24Z	Worst train company ever.	The worst train service ever, you can expect your desired train to be delayed on a daily basis, as well as the shocking condition of the seats on most of the trains.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1

2020-03-14T18:22:24Z	Southern railway useless morons	If I could give South Eastern a 0 I would. An all round appalling service, making hard working people late to work every morning due to cancelling trains and cramming people onto as many as they can. The statement “20 minutes to Central London” for the new flats at Kidbrooke is an absolute farce, it takes 40 if you’re lucky in the worstconditions.

The girl at Victoria station is horrid and when asked a simple question looked up at me with just her eyes and with this Scowl on her face just nodded. I understand it’s Sunday morning but if you don’t want your job give it to someone that wants and needs it.

2020-03-14T18:22:24Z	Very dissapointed with their service	My experience of using them.  Punctuality: the journey into London was late by 18 minutes. The journey home was 8 minutes late departing. Value: £15:20 for a return is ridiculous. Other cities in the world charge significantly less for a comparative journey. Seating: None available.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-11-21T11:23:26Z	There seems to be constant issues.	There just seems to be constant delays/cancellations. For example I have been delayed or had my train cancelled 7 times in the past 3 weeks, and I only travel 5 days a week so that means 7/15 days there have been issues.They charge extortionate amounts (in line with the UK, but not the rest of the world) and the service is awful. Station staff on a whole do not seem to care much, and the online customer service team will just provide you with template answers. Yes, I understand they have a delay-repay system in place, but I would like the service I pay for and no refunds, rather than having to take time out of my day if I wish to be compensated for a companies ineptitude.The worst thing is that most people who use this service need to use it in order to go to work so you have to put up with it and keep lining the pockets of a greedy, inept company.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	2
2019-11-21T11:23:26Z	Unreliable 'service'	Unreliable 'service', trains often late or cancelled, overcrowded, dirty and very expensive.

2019-11-21T11:23:26Z	Very very poor at the best of times but…	"Very very poor at the best of times but tonight was the absolute worst. Had brought a weekender ticket Saturday, went to visit my parents and it was only on the train home on Sunday I realised I had thrown away the wrong part of the ticket for the return journey. Guard on the train was very understanding as it clearly says 'Weekender' on it but when I reached my station at the next end I was met with an eye roll from the woman on the barriers alongside a sarcastic comment of ""Well you are very lucky you didn't receive a fine then aren't you??"" as she looked me up and down clearly not believing me before I was allowed to pass through. Whilst yes I appreciate there are people out there who do 'dodge the fares' I do not appreciate basically being accused of lying when it was a genuine mistake...such a bad attitude alongside constant late running of dirty, overcrowded trains that often have either dirty or broken smelly toilets makes for a very bad travel experience over all."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-11-21T11:23:26Z	Seizure for a penalty fare?	My son has had epilepsy for about a year now, and his triggers for seizures are from getting scared anyway, they charged him with a penalty fare for not buying a £2 ticket then laughed at him saying that he looks like he sh**t his pants. My daughter overheard this conversation. Anyway, when my son came home he was so terrified that this lead to him having a grand-mal seizure. I went to the train station to question them about who wrote the penalty fare, 8 staff members ganged up on me, all men, and laughed in my face when I asked them about who said that my son looked like he sh**t his pants. They were so rude and intimidating. They were insisting that my children lied to me, which if they were lying my son wouldn't have had that outcome. My children are not liars. It's not about the £20 ticket, the fact that your services gang up on adults let alone vulnerable 12 year old children. For not having the time to buy a train ticket. My son had just started getting better and hadn't had a seizure in 5 months since he was diagnosed. Southeastern services, all you care about is your money, and not the wellbeing of others. You disgust me and you should be ashamed of yourselves. If you are going to give little kids seizures, get medical professionals on your team when giving out penalty fares.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1

Do you consider for one minute Southeastern that some of us work weekends and worse weekend nights shifts? Do you really think I want to be stuck on one of your hellish buses for an extra 45 minutes after I just worked a 12 hour night shift?? Why can’t you do your works at night?? I work nights why cant you? Why do you think it’s perfectly ok to screw up someone’s commute and cost me precious sleep because you can’t get your act together and maintain your tracks.  Are you going to reimburse me for the £200 I’ve spent this year getting cabs home because I’mToo exhausted to sit on a bus when I should be on a train?

To be honest I’m surprised you haven’t charged them for multiple tickets 4) cleanliness - the trains stink of p*ss which is wonderful on the journey home from work... overall 0/10	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1

Got on a train from work, train suddenly stopped then driver said due to red signalThen all lights & power switched off. No announcements made by driver then get to next station where train stops again for ages. Station staff told everyone to get off because of fault on train. Staff rude and show no customer empathy. Then msg on PR system told to move away from train otherwise trains will be diverted. Driver switched fans off. Train boiling hot and not moving. What an absolute disgrace. Wrote to CEO, David Statham, and copied my local MP. No wonder the government stripped the franchise of this Company. They are an absolute joke to British railways. Sack them all and get a new reliable operator...	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-11-21T11:23:26Z	Pathetic	Appalling service.  Extremely overpriced.  Most of their rolling stock is decades old.  Cannot even sit comfortably in many of the trains due to leg room being insufficient to even get your legs in if you are 6’ or above.  Although you can now connect to WiFi, it does not connect to the internet.  Complaints process is (likely deliberately) painstakingly slow and inefficient.If there is a government incentive to get people onto public transport, this isn’t it.  If only the government would put something in place that is not run by foreign investment companies, who only favour profit over service.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1

2019-07-10T17:46:30Z	Southeasternrailway	"This company is responsible for the majority of stress in my life.Pay over 400 per month to stand in an oven with 900 people melting together. Be told that ""We can't physically run more trains"" when they send 1 train an hour at maximum. Pure profit over people.To see how bad this company is - you just need to look at their refund process - which involves having to mail the physical ticket copies to them following use - with the staff at gates pretty much desperate to not allow you to keep the ticket this can be difficult. You will need to confirm the exact time you brought the ticket - or they will decide it did not belong to you. I don't think this refund process is appropriate for a public service, but, they have the monopoly on transport to London so can do as they please.The southeastern key does not work, there have been periods of a few weeks where I've not been able to use it a single time after again paying hundreds of pounds. I try to contact customer service but they have no idea. The ""Key Team"" takes 10 working days to respond to a query.I don't know whether the customer service staff on the phone are just really upset all the time because all they get is complaints, but frankly the way they speak to customers is pretty naff and particularly accusatory as if they are targeted to help as few people as possible, it reflects very much SouthEastern's general attitude towards us individuals who don't own a helicopter, and who have no other choice but to use their service.  I really hate having a go at human staff, but when they are worse than the Gas or Electric company it warrants a mention.The one plus I will give is to the staff in tube stations, they have one of the hardest (and as we recently found out) on of the most unhealthy jobs around due to the unsafe air standards on the underground.Wow - I've never given a company a bad rating before.

This consists of an hourly service (if I'm lucky) and not getting a seat on the train. If I am unfortunately running late and miss this, I am reduced to taking the slow connecting train which is timed so idiotically that you miss the connecting train 1 minute before you arrive on the platform - hence a 15 min wait, with a coma inducing slow af slow train that gets to Folkestone which feels like it's going at walking pace. God forbid there are any delays less than 29 mins. The stingy company are reluctant to pay a single penny back of their extortionate fares. Where is the government regulation when it comes to this? Robbing me of about a third of my hard earned salary. Ridiculous."	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1

Considering the poor service (late or cancelled trains) that usually run on this service, I always make sure that I check with a member of staff so that I am not late for work.

And every time, when i realized that now it’s time for southeastern railway, i just wanted to cry. 1stly: trains are overcrowded (but okay, peak time, that i underu). 2ndly: the temperature in the train is just horrible, it’s literally like you are coming in sauna, and even after complaining to their official website 3 times, of course it didn’t change something. 3dly: there is no ticket control (almost); 4ly: timing. There is completely different part. Every single time (literally) it’s delayed (from 10 mins up to 1 hour or even cancelled). EVERY single time train just stopped in the middle of rails from 5 to 20 mins (every time i was counting). The fact that trains are dirty, i even don’t want to count. To sum up: how is that kind of service can exist in London???	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-07-10T17:46:30Z	Poor Service, Lack or Competition	I have no choice but to use Southeastern trains from Ramsgate to London on a frequent basis, the service is the worst I have ever experienced.  Overcrowded infrequent trains, poor to zero ticket control, constant declassified 1st class.  This is not the fault of front line staff. It is poor planning and poor execution.  I pray they do not have their contract renewed again and am efficient replacement can be found.  I can’t think of anywhere else that this sort of shoddy operation would be tolerated.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-07-10T17:46:30Z	Not much we can do can we ?	Unfortunately I have to write a bad review about their operations management ! I’ve seen them all ... I travel for work and the amount of ridiculousness I have witnessed is incredible !! From trains being delayed more than half an hour because of a “bicycle” hitting a barrier... a driver not coming to work .... 1 person get sick on the train and I was blocked for 35 min on the train behind ... let’s not even speak about “signalling problems” ... EVERY SINGLE DAY !!!! Considering the price we are paying I would try to do better !!  3 weeks ago a electrical panel went on fire and all trains going towards Kent cancelled for hours .... really !? No backups ?! No security backups !?  Another issue is refunds !!! Weeks after weeks of waiting for so many refunds ....	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	2
2019-07-10T17:46:30Z	Definition of unreliable	Definition of unreliable. Delays and cancellations every day. I live in Eltham and for the past 3 years I honestly think I am psychologically scarred by the delays, cancellations and chaos that is South Eastern trains. Excuses upon excuses of why trains are cancelled and the ones you get at the station usually don't match the train conductor's. I used to have a season ticket but now refuse to pay them money in advance, so I use pay as you go on my card - for which there is no option on their website to claim money for delays. Trains are really slow - takes you as long to get into Charing Cross from Eltham as it would to go from Marylebone to Aylesbury (and that's at least 4 times further) Generally I don't think this company cares for its passenger, the board and senior management should resign and just hand over to the TFL in a hope that someone else could maybe manage this disaster of a railway.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-07-10T17:46:30Z	Is this real train	Is this real train? I don't think so. As the prices went up and services going worst. Paying so much money and never could get the train on the time. I give you 1star but you even don't deserve.How come these trains used to run on the time and on the same railway and prices was a lot cheaper? but nowadays prices are doubled and barely could get the train on time. Is it really	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-01-11T08:49:35Z	Pathetic	Forever delayed. Forever rising prices for apparent improvements in services HAHAHA ok then .  Don’t catch a south eastern train , catch aids.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-01-11T08:49:35Z	Overpriced and poor service	There is no single week in which there is no delay (or sometimes trains cancelled because of a train failure of a member of  staff missing. This is ridiculous! ).  Extremely expensive from Folkestone to London and very poor service and disrespect for their customers. My train to Charing Cross was cancelled and I was told to get yhe High-speed and change in Ashford. Then another member of staff said that I could stay on the High-speed because of the disruption, but when I got to the barrier the other member of staff wasn't aware about the stamp to allow passengers to continue their journey because of the disruption. And even with the stamp, which should allowed passengers to continue their journey because of the disruption, wasn't clear for the members of staff of London underground.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-01-11T08:49:35Z	Avoid if at all possible	Avoid if at all possible. Often late, almost always dirty and uncomfortable, and staff are seldom willing and/or able to help. And whatever you do, visit the loo before you board. You never know when they’ll breakdown just outside Lewisham and make you wait 5 hours before rescue.They are the worst company I’ve ever had to deal with. And VERY expensive too. The continued favour shown to them by government is a scandal.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-01-11T08:49:35Z	Overpriced and always late	Honestly this service doesn’t even deserve 1 star. I have moved from Manchester to Kent over a year ago and have started a new job about 2 months ago. The train I get from Sevenoaks should arrive at Staplehurst for 07:33am. In these two months I have had 30 trips (outward journey) and only 3 of these trips have been on time. When I complained to the railway service I was told that it is acceptable if the train is a few minutes late. Well this is not acceptable to me as it means I am late to work everyday and have to make up the time! If that’s the case then it should be acceptable for passengers to pay less. This is ridiculous and something needs to be done about it, but it doesn’t seem like Southeastern even care. Its frustrating and to make matters worse there are only two train each hour! I had never heard of this until I moved to Kent. Trains should run more frequently (every 15-20mins) to make up for delays and cancelled trains. By the way one of my trains got cancelled because of ‘heavy rain’.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-01-11T08:49:35Z	Pathetic members of staffs & customers service	I’ve had a few bad experiences with the members of staff of this company. Sometimes, certain reluctance happens and very rare would let me through at the ticket barrier but some are just downright cynical and pathetic vultures and are terrible people. I am a very understanding person and rarely ever dub anyone as terrible, especially strangers and professions because I wouldn’t know them well enough to judge, but this, I cannot tolerate.Me and my friends were hanging out in London when we took the train from London Charing Cross. One of my friends asked one of the staffs at the tickets barrier when and why does the ticket barriers sometimes open for people to pass for free, just out of curiosity, he had no intention of fare-dodging. The staff grew rapidly aggressive towards my friend and was “what are you talking about? How do you know that? You have to pay for your tickets !” my friend tried explaining again ‘cause he thought he may not been clear at first but the staff was still aggressive towards him. My friend, who is a very mature and charismatic guy got pretty clicked by that staff’s attitude.My second experience was more personal, I was at London Victoria, one hour freaking delay on the train and it was 10pm, so I decided to go to Charing Cross instead. When I got out the train, I remember I have already tapped in and now the barriers are opened so I didn’t know whether I should tap out and if I tap out, would they still take my money away because they did say they will give us compensation. So I decided to ask a member of staff who was just passing by, then this man DELIBERATELY ignored me and kept on walking and talked to his colleagues. Making himself feel like he’s the Queen of England and I’m some moppy beggar peasant. Then he continued standing around and just walking around, clearly having nothing to do while knowing there’re trains that are delaying for over an hour and customers are frustrated. I don’t usually wish poorly on anyone but I hope his socks got wet walking to work the next day.Thirdly, I was hanging out with my little brother in central London, he was 15 at the time so he had a 11-15 oyster card. But then he lost it so he renewed another and was waiting for it to arrive. In the meantime, he would buy a child ticket for £6.30. One day these ticket officers came and checked his ticket, asked him his birthday so he said it but they didn’t believe him. So they asked him for an ID, he didn’t have his passport so he showed them his student ID card. They freaking didn’t accept it and ask for something more valid which he didn’t have so they fined him £20 fare. For a god damn kid !Finally, just recently actually. I have to get up early every Monday and Friday for college in central and I would go to Clock House Station and get to either Charing Cross or Cannon Street. Then one morning, as usual, I got to Clock House, perfectly timed to top up my oyster card and get down to my platform but then this day, the ticket machine didn’t accept credit cards and I didn’t have any cash on me, the nearest cash machine is 2 minutes walk away but then I would definitely miss my train. The ticket office wasn’t even working as well. So I just hopped on my train and hoping I can explain to the ticket officers and pay for cheapest ticket fares there. But when I got there. First off, the man at the barrier was incredibly mean and sarcastic “Look, we don’t know ok? Go ask the ticket office”, I could see it in his smirks. Then I asked the ticket office, two ticket officers came to me, I explained what happened, THEY DIDN’T BELIEVE ME and tried making any teeny-tiny loopholes to circumvent my argument such as “oh but then you should’ve planned and come to the station much earlier”, I thought that was stupid because it doesn’t matter how late or early I came to the station, the ticket machine or office was working so what difference would it make? I had zero intention of fare-dodging and I was prepare to pay for a travel card or whatever but they made me pay a £20 penalty fare. To make it worse, they mistaken me for a woman, I thought it was a joke at first but then realized they were serious. I was incredibly upset with the energies I received from these people, I couldn’t make it to my college anyway because it was late so I decided to just head back home. I was sitting on the train trying to hold my tears, not because I got a penalty fare but I’m overwhelmed of how low-cunning, rude and unsympathetic some people are. I’m pretty understanding of people, I have family members who specializes in the services industry so I get a lot of insights and respects for the enterprise, then seeing how poorly these employees behave, it’s disappointing and sad how some of them are getting paid for being vultures. I get that the law should be strict and all, I get these people need to collect silvers from us for wages but damn it, some of these things are not even that serious but their attitudes surely drove me, and many others I assume, to the wall.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2019-01-11T08:49:35Z	Intimidating, sexist, rude staff making a quick buck	Seeing as this company does not seem to reply to complaints I'll post mine here.This complaint is regarding the treatment I received from a member of staff on the 4th of April at London Victoria station. I do not know this member of staff's name, but the authorised collector's number is E10057.I travelled up from Maidstone east, I did get to the station in time to use the ticket machine however I rarely travel by train and so I wasn't sure what ticket was valid for which journeys; I also needed the correct receipt for my travel to claim it back from work. In short, the machine was not helpful or informative enough for me to purchase from it. There were no staff present so I was unable to purchase my ticket. I walked straight to the ticket desk at Victoria to purchase my fare, plus the additional tickets I needed for the rest of my journey. As I approached the desk there was a member of staff dealing with another female passenger in an overly aggressive manner. This put me somewhat on edge and to be honest I did not want him to ask him anything. But he was the only member of staff I had found up to this point. So I said I needed a return fare from Maidstone east, and I also wanted a travel card for the underground, and I also wanted an itemised receipt so I could claim it back off work. This is the point where I began to feel very intimidated. He informed me that he was from the 'revenue office' and as I didn't have a ticket at this point he was going to have to give me a penalty fare. This man did not listen to a word I said. I was not fare dodging, I had no reason to fare dodge. My employer was paying my travel expenses, I made it very clear that I wanted to purchase a by-no-means cheap travel ticket from him. I had to pay for the fine on the spot. Which I have discovered in your terms and conditions I should have been offered the option to pay within the week. I had to pay on my credit card because I couldn't afford it. I specifically told this member of staff. Is it common practise to train your staff to ignore what the customer is saying to them, to belittle them, to bully them and show no human decency whatsoever? This man was a common, sexist, bully. How is it my fault that you do not have any staff to help at the station? What's more I do not have any way of claiming my travel back from work. I have had to pay the full amount. I cannot afford that. So now I am out of pocket as well. I would also like to state that this member of staff commented that I looked confused and said I clearly don't use the trains very often. So he had a good laugh at my expense too. Silly girl who doesn't know how the trains work. What happened basic decent customer service? I was an easy, vulnerable and ideal target for this kind of intimidation for you to make a few extra easy bucks. And I am outraged. And no one has responded to my emails regarding this	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1

Train journeys are not reliable in the slightest. Delayed or cancelled due to pathetic reasons far too regularly! Sick to the teeth of extended journeys and being late for work because southeastern railway are as good at rail travel as fred and rose west are at babysitting! Pathetic! Sort your company or lower the price of tickets to match the pathetic excuse for standards you work to! If any other company pulled half the crap you guys pull as a company they would be arrested for extortion and deception on the highest level! I once had to ride home from work (eastchurch near queenborough to rochester) because your trains were cancelled and the bus replacement service wouldn't allow my bicycle on the bus!

When the guard came around and checked her railcard,unbeknownst to her it had run out by a couple of days, so he charged her over £40, on top of what she had already paid and left her with nothing in her purse. She was supposed to meet her friends for a night out, but came straight home, as she was embarrassed about not being able to buy a drink.I think the way she was treated was disgusting and she doesn't want to use the train again.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1

It is a rip off.You cannot buy a weekly ticket in advance to avoid long ques. If you put in a claim for compensation you never get a response or ack. Please nationalise this service and bring in staff that care about customers who will clean the trains and w.c. and make sure they are working. Early in the mornig you want to sleep and you are woken up for ticket checks. They are quick to fine you but not quick to open up their shutters when you come home from work to buy a ticket.

2018-05-30T10:56:24Z	Normally a good service, sometimes, not.	Normally, their train service is acceptable, expensive, fairly comfortable, even the toilets work (sometimes).  The staff are usually really good, if a bit exasperated (they do not complain, it is just they are often dealing with tricky circumstances); although, sad to say, one guard prompted a complaint for her dictatorial behaviour (guarding an empty First Class on an  overloaded train, the company seems to have changed policies since).  During the recent snow, I am afraid that they failed to provide security and nearly emptied out a train because the horn stopped working, but after 5 minutes of 250 passengers standing puzzled in the snow, they let them reboard and went at 20mph, which was the right thing to do.  Generally, the service is okay.  Sometimes, trains get delayed due to staff not getting to Victoria, there are too many delays but it is the exception rather than the rule.  Looking forward to continued expected improvement.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	3

After the customer service told me “2018 after the themes link program everything will be sorted” After a 2017 full of delayed and cancelled trains. After accepting (not really) this fare increases over an already crazy amount of money for a really unacceptable service. After the struggles to be at work and at home always late in 2017 and 2016... Back again to work, positive for a better service and....Morning train, delayed for slow progression. Evening train, cancelled because of a faulty.Second evening train delayed 30 minutes for congestion. And obviously now slow progression till home. Now, Do I need to pay 66 pounds more per year, for what? For a even more unacceptable  service? Please I’d like to understand, really. What’s your problem? You are really making me and some friends of mine think to move out of the south or even out of the country. I can’t imagine to continue like this for years and years of working life. Spending a lot of money for a service that probably is one of the worst in Europe, where in other places services like yours are much more efficient, with more optional (WiFi, just to mention one) and the ticket costs half of yours. Unluckily I didn't know you were so bad before moving in kent... I wish I can go back and change my destination.

Taking 20 children on a train is quite stressful but was made so much easier by the lovely guards on both the forward and return trips. We were apologetic that it might take a bit longer to get them all on but they were helpful and funny and the safety of the children was their immediate concern. The trains both ways were also dead on time. I know i am not a regular train user and i can understand the frustration the service can sometimes cause (and the cost!) but on this occassion i wanted to say thank you to all concerned and this is an extremely good ""advert"" as to why the train guards should not be scrapped!"	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1

But there are very often delays, cancellations or you get 6 carriages instead of 12 which is very annoying. Still better than bus.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	5
2018-05-30T10:56:24Z	Often late but clean and decent.	To start with the positives:- Finally removed all of the old 'slam shut' trains and have increased the quality/maintenance of those in operation.However...negatives:- Frequently late.- Prices increase out of kilter with the level of service improvements made.- Ability to respond when trains are late, systems fail etc is poor, both on their app (which is hit an miss) and in terms of informed staff at stations.-Processing a 'late train' claim takes in excess of 10 days, to which their usual response is that 'our system says otherwise' - usually the same system that was incorrectly reporting at the time. There is no email or number to then complain upon from their automated response - the only way to question their response is to WRITE in.Terrible company, service and satisfaction levels are clearly unimportant and their available communication mediums are worse than those expected from companies stuck in 1990.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	3
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Unhelpful from King Cross	Unhelpful from King Cross, the staff was annoyed and rude.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Unreliable, shoddy	Unreliable, shoddy service. Lots of cancellations,  lots of delays, drivers don'tturn up. Completely unacceptable in this day & age. This excuse for a service has made me late for work so many times (Dartford, Sidcup lines) I have lost count.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Actually a good train line!	You know what despite some bad feedback on here I actually really like southeastern, they rarely have train disputation IE:works on the Trainline and when they do they give you plenty of notice and make it clear.....by putting up posters at stations, all over Twitter and other social media so you have enough time to make other arrangements. I have found that when something happens like signal fault or someone on the tracks they are quick to resolve the problem and bring service back to normal......I use south south eastern everyday to get to and from work at peak and non peak hours including really early trains and late trains and I rarely have problems with them. Compared to other train networks like great northern and southern that are absolutely shambolic with daily delays, daily issues on the train lines, cancelled trains last minute I actually can’t fault southeastern.  For people complaining about timetables if your a frequent southeastern customer you should know by now they change to summer and autumn time tables and should be checking before you travel train times to avoid issues and give yourself enough time to get to the station and wait! It’s abit of common sense, throughout covid trains were still running at a reasonable service not as frequent As I would like but frequent enough and for people like me that are key workers working throughout covid this was excellent and a life saver, saving me from tubing and getting several busses, I just checked trains before I travel and made sure I knew the train times. I have been travelling on south eastern for around 5 years now and genuinely can not fault the company compared to other appalling ones I’ve experienced.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	4
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Absolutely horrible…	SE have always been unreliable operator incapable of running normal services,but now they went even further. As of 7th of September they introduced a new timetable,which they claim would run 98% of pre-COVID trains. This is an absolute lie and they know it. In reality they have cut 50% of rush hour trains from my station (Chelsfield),removed all fast services and left only one direct to Charing Cross. They make us do multiple changes of stations and trains ,exposing us to COVID at a greater rate. Their replies are pointless and you can clearly feel they are just annoyed and want you to disappear. Obviously there is no alternative and we have to use this horrible company which makes it even more frustrating	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	John @Sevenoaks Station	We were looking to have a partial refund for a train ticket after wrongly being charged for an adult price despite it being for a child. John at the ticket office of Sevenoaks station was rude, unfriendly and took over 10 minutes to complete the task leaving us annoyed and dissatisfied with the service!!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	I Booked the tickets but i can’t go…	I Booked the tickets but i can’t go because of the gov.uk keep changing  the corridor countries  that need to quarantine after coming back from France. I emailed the train customer service with so little hope that I can change the date of tickets as I purchased the non changable ticks. I received the reply on the same date and was offered the refund. After I replied back that I want to get the refund. I received the confirmation of the refund straight away. The email was written so politely. I am very pleased and would recommend if you have a problem, try to contact them. I went to their website and fill in the contact us form with few screens shot of my tickets and the evidences why i cannot travel.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	5
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Always reliable and helpful	Trains always on time these days, trains much cleaner than they used to be and information about delays or disruption much more publicised. So glad TFL don't run this service, there are actual ticket offices and staff that can help you at most stations, something TFL got rid of at underground stations.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	5
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Can’t praise the rail staff enough	My mobility isn’t good and staff at Dover Priory; Ashford International and London Bridge stations went out of their way to make my journey easy and pleasant when attending Guy’s hospital recently on 7th Aug. I thank them all so much	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	5
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Great Staff	Just wanted to come on here and say Phillip who assists at Stratford International is an exceptionally wonderful man!I had one of the worst days ever and he went above and beyond to help me. You are extremely lucky to have him!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	5
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	The WORST train company to ever exist	The WORST train company to ever exist. Constantly incompetent.Cancelling late night trains forcing me to get a 2 hour night bus home. Unsafe and irresponsible. People rely on this utter disgrace of a service and just to get disappointed again and again. Unfortunately they take advantage of people having no other choice and are unlikely to change their ways. Aside from this, the price they charge is astronomical and it’s disgusting considering the condition most trains on the London line are in. Despicable, terrible service and all customers need to be compensated for their continued failures.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Unreliable, greedy and overall poor excuse of a railway operator	I have been forced to use Southeastern Railway for years had have nearly nothing positive to say. They know that commuters rely on their service so hike the prices up but can't even provide a decent service.The only reliable thing about southeastern is that you know your train will either be late or cancelled without any notice.To top it off, if you dare ask for compensation they will offer peanuts in return. For example, i paid about 25 quid for a return from London to Rochester, the last couple trains were cancelled so we were unable to get home. Had to stay at a friend's house and pay for another ticket the next day so already out of pocket. How much compensation did i get? About 5 pounds.They don't care about their passengers and are useless. Needs to be handed back to the government, these private companies are a disgrace to treat the British public this way.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Should be below 1 star	Should be below 1 star. Disgraceful lazy service. Completely unreliable service and staff. They’ll happily cancel all trains beyond a station at the drop of a hat and then make zero effort to arrange busses or alternatives, their boards will not indicate the cancellations, then you see their lazy staff mucking about and reading the paper rather than informing customers. They are playing on COVID to be even lazier, we’re all back at work (some of us are critical workers so had to be) so run a proper service and stop conning us out of money.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	What a shambles	What a shambles. Advised to get on the 'fast' train to Ashford International to meet a connection for Canterbury. Train delayed and didn't wait for connection for 5 minutes. Now got to wait for 55 minutes for next train. Poor management of trains and I'm stuck on the hottest day of the year in a train station due to inept management.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Southeastern	I live in Orpington in Kent. The only way to get to see my family and friends. Is by train and I am forced to use this terrible service. Having to pay for a really expensive travel card for a start. Then you wait what feel like eternity for the crappy train to arraive. Sitting a smelly dirty train with no working toilets	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Staff and passenger safety during Covid-19 crisis.	I think it is outrageous how your own website states that we as customers should be wearing face coverings on your transport systems. However- none of your staff are? Upon mentioning this to one of the station staff, they told me that Southeastern are refusing to let their staff wear face masks or coverings. Clearly you do not value your staffs safety nor any of your customers. This needs to be reviewed to keep both your own staff and customers safe ASAP	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Absolutely terrible customer service	Both my husband and I pay around £2,600 each for an annual ticket and have done so for over 10 years.One of our tickets did not expire until May 2020 and we have not been able to use it from March due to the COVID 19 situation.  Submitted the refund claim as per the website and receive a reply to say.... we understand the testing times and current difficult situation etc but after our administration fee, you refund due is £2. That won't even buy a single ticket to the next station on our train line. Personally I would be embarrassed to have to write that email to a customer! It would be much more helpful to credit the remaining duration on this ticket, on to the next season ticket we buy.  The situation is also beyond our control and we are not simply choosing to avoid travelling to work, it's the recommendation for everyone's safety. Would be nice to factor a bit of common sense in to the process.	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	I feel compelled to write a review…	I feel compelled to write a review regards the Customer Service team at South Eastern who have been fantastic. Due to the current COVID-19 I have been waiting an annual season ticket refund. I spoke with 3 x separate advisors who were incredibly sympathetic, patient and thorough. A credit to the organisation in the current climate - thank you!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	5
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Take you money quickly, but seem to be unable to refund you - AVOID	Travel every day (before the pandemic!) and always get a seat on rush hour trains to / from London. Generally comfy and clean, and reasonably on time. Travel a lot at weekends to other parts of Kent and always good at the weekends. Staff usually friendly and helpful. Delay Repay paid really quick when I apply. Would like to see more done about the fare dodgers who I see on the trains at weekends though!	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	1
2020-10-24T09:15:38Z	Does what it's supposed to do, and staff always great. No real complaints!	Train cancelled last minute , I have a disabled pass for my disability and been trying to get a refund for my tickets from the 7th of march keeps getting rejected. Tried to get a refund at the station apparently you have to be charged a £10 admin charge..... Right. So I have to do it online but can't as you don't give refunds to people.Edit : Southeastern got back to me and gave me 80p for my £5.70 ticket.....Criminals and pisstakers	https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk	4
