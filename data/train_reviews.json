Southampton Central is easily the worse run station ever, they seem to cancel trains all the time for absolutely no reason then give you stick for attempting your journey another way or tell you try again tomorrow and merely shrug their shoulders when you ask what is going on. I have also witnessed a member of public being verbally harassed by one of the train guards when she was desperately trying to get home but they cancelled many trains for absolutely no reason.

In other developed countries trains run regularly and on time and the company cares when things go wrong. In other developed countries trains are quick and comfortable. Not in Britain. I am currently sat on an already delayed train which is pointing in the direction of Brighton but hasn't moved for the past 15 minutes due to a 'problem'. We have been given no other information nor how long we expect to wait. This is typical of the British railway system and I am in no way surprised; it is second nature for me to factor delays into my journeys now. One positive is that there is no need to worry about missing your train in Britain as they are always at least 5 minutes late, and often closer to 15. I am now stood on the platform of an unknown station after being kicked off the train to Brighton which was deemed unservicable, and I am still not surprised. The price I payed for this third-world service was appalling and the price of trains in general means it is often cheaper to fly to your destination via Spain or Ireland, as well as quicker, easier, more reliable and more comfortable. The entire British rail system is a national disgrace from head office to the 'service' itself. Someone is currently locked in the toilet of the unservicable train and as a result it cannot move to make way for the replacement. The temperature is minus 3.

Having had a poor journey to Birmingham international 14 days previous due to ignorant unhelpful platform staff at Newport and Birmingham ( At Newport they were more interested at sitting in there cabin than helping) we thought that things could only get better, how wrong were we. Well lets start at the beggining: After arriving via the shuttle to Birmingham International at around 8.45pm we could find nobody to ask what platform we needed for a train to Birmingham New Street so we had to figure it out ourselves via the info screens. Having arrived at Birmingham new street we spotted a platform guard so we waited for him to dispatch the train and asked him for the platform we needed to catch our train to Bristol Parkway well he was very rude and told us he did not know so we would have to use the info screen upstairs, what chance have we got of trains running smoothly if he did not know what train runs from what platform?. Having dragged our luggage between us 5 adults and 3 young children we figured it out. Arriving at Bristol Parkway we asked the platform attendant for the right platform for Newport expecting the same attitude as the last guard but to our suprise he was extremely helpful giving us the info we needed and helping us with the lift and pointing out that we could use the waiting room pointing out that we could turn the heaters on as we had over an hour to wait but then came the bad news the train was delayed due to signalling issues. Once the train arrived the guard was very helpful and helped us board the train as we had 6 pieces of luggage. Once on the train more bad news was announced \" Due to signalling issues we had to do a detour that would add around 45 minutes to our journey \" just what we did not need.We arrived at Newport at 02.15 instead of 01.27.

I woke up in the morning with a sore throat and hoarseness, and my voice hasn't recovered even now, 10 days later. I can only think that the reason it wasn't fixed in a timely manner has something to do with the fact that the trains are soon to be replaced. On one leg of the only other journey I have made with Caledonian sleeper, there was a problem with the ventilation which meant we had to sleep with the doors open to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Presumably some suit in an office somewhere decided it would be a shrewd business move to spend money on advertising the new fleet of trains, rather then rushing to ensure that customers have a comfortable journey in existing trains that will soon go out of use.

After waiting 2 hours in the freezing cold station at Glasgow where actual snow flakes were coming through the roof our train back to London Euston flashed up cancelled. I asked the Virgin staff what should we do and the only advice given by a truly fed up female member of their staff was to download their train app and twitter for live updates. When asked but we are now stranded the female shrugged her shoulders put her arms out and said frostily \"nothing I can do\"! We were \"abandoned\" for 4 days without an offer of them finding accommodation, food or drink.....yet they had a duty of care which they failed dismally to provide. Their tweets advised each day that trains would leave Glasgow yet when you looked on Euston they were ALL cancelled and I had to tweet them to say their live updates were in fact incorrect. We discovered by mere chance they were starting to bus passengers from Glasgow to Carlisle where trains were now running ....this information was on Teletext but not Twitter! So the following morning (day 4 of being abandoned) we drudged our way down to the station in the snow at 7.00am without breakfast or a hot drink. We expected a notice to advise passengers we expected a member of Virgin staff to be on hand but there was no one! I had to ask the ticket sales manager who advised connection buses were laid on yesterday but Virgin staff didn't want to make it public as they would be unindated instead it was by mere chance if passengers found out.....shocking! This was infuriating to say the least as we could have got home a day early saving the added expense of a night's accommodation, food, drink not to mention our 2 dogs who had been stuck in kennels. The bus turned up shortly after 8am and we were ushered on to it. No provision of hot drinks or food which could have been provided by Virgin as nearby food outlets were open. We travelled to Carlisle station where on the platform there were a handful of Virgin staff in a huddle keeping their distance from the passengers. We had to approach them for advice. We purchased our own drinks + food from the nearby kiosk but again no offer from Virgin despite their passenger charter of providing refreshment and food where possible....well it was possible! On the train to Preston the buffet car was shut due to passengers sitting on the floor....the train was rammed. We had to change at Preston to catch another train to Milton Keynes. And it wasn't until we had just left Birmingham that food was finally provided.....unfortunately no hot drinks as the boiler had broken! It has taken 55 days to get a reply to my complaint and to be reimbursed for accommodation only apparently on this occasion they are not reimbursing food and drink....How do they expect us to be stuck with a bill out of our control whilst in their care?! I might add I had to chase the reply up on numerous occasions .....online chats as Virgin obviously don't have human beings that can talk on a phone! Managers were apparently always in meetings leaving their staff to front the online chats and some not very successfully either. I was constantly being promised a reply with 10 working days....5 working days....by the end of the week.....oh you will receive it by next Wednesday as our printer for the cheques has broken! Fobbed off big time and to think a big company like Virgin only have \"one\" printer to print the cheques....yeah right! The letter was a standard reply which lacked empathy or sincerity for any remorse regarding our stranded situation. They barely apologised. So why did it take 55 days to reply? Their website states 28 days which again they clearly failed like their trains.

There were people who would not have got on that train if they had been told this originally. They were all simply dumped at Carlisle and told that they'd have to wait there until the line re-opened (which was being measured in days rather than hours), or go back towards London. There were no more hotel rooms available in Carlisle, which is quite a small town. I was travelling across the country to Newcastle so I was not directly affected, but I felt so desperately sorry for all these poor stranded people. I sat next to a quite elderly  lady who had joined the train to Carlisle because she had been told by Virgin staff it was going on to Glasgow and was now having to travel to Newcastle just to find a hotel room. There is no way that Virgin central command, wherever that is, did not already know that the line to Glasgow was blocked, but their customer service is so routinely appalling that they didn't feel it necessary to share accurate information with the public, let alone make any attempt to help people who were stranded. From now on I am only travelling with Transpennine.

One day between trains and a completely different experience in the second. The first journey provided great service tables set out, hot food choices, wine available as well as soft drinks and the staff couldn\u2019t do enough for us. When we boarded for the second leg we were abruptly by one of the onboard staff members who firstly advised we were in the wrong place (I wasn\u2019t as I booked and paid a fortune for anytime) and then rudely advised me that as I had boarded an earlier train than originally planned I wouldn\u2019t have my pre reserved seats. I understood this but I paid a lot of money for anytime as I knew my plans were likely to change and did not expect such a rude response.  The next thing is the choice of a wrap (very nice if you like spicy food) my mum doesn\u2019t or alternatively what equates to a cheese spread sandwich. We asked for a glass of wine with our food and were told that wine is not served on a weekend but we could purchase it from the bar!! Really?? We had it on a Friday and we could buy it from the baron we wanted alcohol so why not serve it within the extortionate price of a first class ticket???? This is ridiculous and certainly not consistent with the choices delivered on our journey the previous day. In the end after paying \u00a3762.00 I went to the bar and paid extra for refreshments and hot food for this sector of our journey which takes almost 4 hours of our total trip. Very disappointing after the excellent service and choice offered previously......absolutely disappointed and surprised at the lack of customer care.", "url": "https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk?page=8", "stars": "star-rating star-rating-1 star-rating--medium"},

There were 4 options in the 24 hours. We picked a package that gave us a train ticket and ferry ticket.  We paid \u00a35 extra for the option which was the train journey and ferry ticket that got us on the fast boat over to Ireland. Unfortunately the train was delayed by 12 minutes. The result was that we were unable to get on the fast ferry and had to wait 2 hours for the next boat, which as it was a slower ferry meant a delay of 4 hours.  There was a whole train of people affected.  Irish ferries told us that we should not have been sold the ticket.  Virgin has told us that the train operator Arriva is responsible not them. When I pointed out to Virgin that they had sold us something not fit for purpose - the train if on time only gets in 30 minutes before the departure of the fast ferry and the close of check in is 30 minutes before departure, so why were they selling the train journey, they stated that the check in closes 30 minutes before departure or on the arrival of the connecting train - when I said this did not happen, Virgin said they could not comment as it was another companies decision.  Virgin are still selling this package, no other train option is given for the fast ferry (ie an earlier train), I have advise them to put the warning on the booking page that if the train is delayed by 10 minutes they will not be able to get the boat, so at least people are warned and can decide whether they want to waste money on a boat they may not be able to get.

The train was absolutely packed because the previous train to Leeds had been cancelled so many people were in danger of missing their last connecting train en route to Leeds. Ms Smart was in constant contact with all the passengers on her train,reassuring everyone that she would do everything in her power to get everyone home - which is exactly what she did!

She was absolutely amazing ..so calm and proficient as she repeatedly walked up and down the train aisle dealing with connecting passengers on a one-to-one basis.I've been on delayed trains before,I remember the stress and comments from angry passengers, but on this particular train,no-one, as far as I could hear/see was complaining ..quite the contrary actually! Ms Smart somehow transmitted an unusual sense of serenity and was absolutely meticulous in her directions ..for example \"passengers leaving the train at station X should disembark at exit door X ..your connecting train is waiting for you on platform X We're arriving on platform X so all you have to do is X\" So hats off to Ms Kirsty Smart for her highly professional customer-care skills and hats off to Virgin trains for employing someone who can keep your flag flying even in adverse circumstances!", "url": "https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrains.co.uk?page=10", "stars": "star-rating star-rating-5 star-rating--medium"},

No matter how many times I did this, the new seat selection would not save. I called customer service and was told that it was probably a fault on the web site. I could either book the seats and then try to change them,( not guaranteed) or just delete and start the booking procedure again.

I have repeatedly missed appointments because of broken down trains, failed overhead lines, etc. During the recent snow the line north of Newcastle was blocked for days, and while I accept this is the responsibility of Network Rail, what really makes me angry is that Virgin's response to this is to issue a blanket announcement, 'Do not travel'. No attempt to provide details of where exactly the problems are and how to get round them. Every day just, don't travel.  I am delighted that Virgin has abandoned the east coast franchise and would like to see it re-nationalised, but I am so angry about the way they have scammed the taxpayer.", "url": "https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.virgintrainseastcoast.com?page=2", "stars": "star-rating star-rating-1 star-rating--medium"},

My daughter was booked into 1st Class on the 18:41 from Edinburgh to Newcastle. I appreciate the weather was extreme and the situation rapidly spiraled out of control. We checked your website for updates as we were well aware of flooding etc in the Borders & Northumberland. Your Website indicated a detour via Carlisle which although was reassuring we thought a bit odd, due to flooding in Cumbria?! We stood with hundreds of other anxious passengers on the main Waverley concourse tracking the 18:41 train as it moved towards its departure time. All it showed was 'On Time' but no platform? As the minutes ticked by and arrival time ticked on, we realized with no updates or reliable information the 18:41 was either cancelled or going no where fast, for obvious reasons. Trying to make sense of PA announcements in that crowd was impossible. We could only see 'Scotrail'Staff reassuring their passengers but where were Virgin Staff, conspicuous by their absence?! The Waverley Information counter was 80 + persons deep. Your website was not updating, I tried Twitter and received supercilious, snarky Tweets from yourselves which did nothing to reassure us. Eventually a woman in a Virgin windbreaker casually informed us that Buses / Coaches were waiting on the Market Street side of Waverley, this triggered a mad scramble up escalators & stairs: (the elderly, infirm & blind took their chances) and as we arrived at the Market Street exit, a bemused BR Policeman informed us there were no Buses / Coaches! Still no Virgin staff to advise or re-assure. Another mad scramble back to the Virgin Ticket Office which was bursting to the rafters. 2 maybe 3 staff trying to advise us, your Passengers. Again no announcements, no staff coming out to speak etc. Hundreds in the queue.  By 19:12:40 (can supply a photo) the 18:41 train was still on the Board as 'Delayed' No it wasn't, it was 'Cancelled' but still no word from Virgin, just hundreds of your passengers trying to glean information and separate the rumors from fact. It became apparent that the single man (can supply a photo) in your Virgin Ticket Office, who despite over whelming odds, was dolling out Taxi Vouchers, to get folk home to Newcastle. Eventually I got my daughter into a party of 4 other ladies all bound for Newcastle, eventually leaving on a highly hazardous road journey to Newcastle Central. I repeat - I fully understand that the weather played havoc with Train departures. I fully appreciate it had been raining for 2 days none stop. I do not appreciate the lack of reliable, reassuring information from Virgin Rail. You have glossy, glitzy and funky PR and TV ads, but when the wet & brown smelly stuff hits the fan, your staff, such as those I could see, had not a clue how to deal with agitated & anxious passengers stranded in Waverley.

No meal or sustenance was provided. Only one poor guard dealing with the train as all other Eurostar attendants hid from the clearly confusing situation. Then to have a condescending and unhelpful customer service politely tell me all the ways they will rip me off as a consumer. My train on route home was also delayed meaning that we would miss another connection - it was just over an hour late - but Eurostar are trying to argue it was 55 minutes late.

But he was having none of it. Concerned by the lack of time i now had due to this rude arrogant man I had no choice now but to run off to somehow find another area with space for me to board. In my frustration of this incident, as I was walking off I shouted 'useless' to which the train manager I had just had my encounter with started screaming 'excuse me' .... 'EXCUSE ME' in my direction. I continued to run to another carriage where I could board, ignoring this man as I was concerned I would not get on the train and I didn't have time to deal with him again.

He was almost three hours late on the original arrival schedule and Cross Country are refusing to refund the cost of the ticket because he neglected to keep track of what times he got onto the various trains he was forced to use.  He was just intent on getting home in one piece.

But he was having none of it. Concerned by the lack of time i now had due to this rude arrogant man I had no choice now but to run off to somehow find another area with space for me to board. In my frustration of this incident, as I was walking off I shouted 'useless' to which the train manager I had just had my encounter with started screaming 'excuse me' .... 'EXCUSE ME' in my direction. I continued to run to another carriage where I could board, ignoring this man as I was concerned I would not get on the train and I didn't have time to deal with him again.

It first communicated changes via emails to its customer database in vague and positive terms promoting transfer of its \u2018reward\u2019 points on a 1:1 basis. It neglected to inform that it\u2019s tier/status points - to provide benefits for travel - would be reset to zero for all members at launch in December 2017.  For customers who accrued points during 2017 it knowingly issued worthless points during the year without any transparency. In communication with its Customer \u2018Care\u2019 team their autopilot response deems this abuse of monopoly both \u2018fair\u2019 and \u2018a level playing field\u2019 for its customers. Without consideration it penalises and disappoints travellers who have desired to access premium level benefits for frequent or premium level tickets. It\u2019s cursory, ill conceived and ill communicated \u2018marketing\u2019 campaign has angered many travellers by erasing their travel history, loyalty, and shows through it's website what appears to be a deliberate intent to remove previous tier status questions from its FAQ sections. Delve into the small print and the Club Eurostar 'terms and conditions' prominently state transition conditions for its reward points, yet omits to inform that status points will be reset to nil. In direct communication it takes a dismissive and unqualified \u2018this matter is closed\u2019 stance to queries to avoid resolution. Their approach to customer service suggests a significant backlog of complaints measured only by achieving a \u2018cases closed\u2019 metric of success. Further research shows it\u2019s CEO, Nicolas Petrovic, was previously Director of Customer Services which worryingly indicates a detached and dismissive approval of a revised loyalty scheme that alienates it\u2019s most precious and valuable core customers. Eurostar deserves it\u2019s one star status (trust pilot does not offer zero star reviews) for its arrogant approach to customer \u2018care\u2019.

I then tried to take them back and she snatched them away and told me not to snatch... my own tickets. She then started swearing in french. I eventually had to speak to a less irrational member of staff which seemed to change the womans mind and she gave our tickets back. The whole time she complained that she had been working since 4am and that people were late and rude to her. She obviously shouldn't be working in a customer based job.

The ticket was bought last week, and all of a sudden, last night, it appeared that there was a daytime train for the price, after all. We went ahead and changed the time and date for a train that put us in Paris around 11:30am, but we had to pay $48 penalty per person to switch it. Really Eurostar? What kind of predatory tactic is this? I see that the penalty information is visible right before you make the change, but at the end of the day, it is inconceivable to feel OK about paying pretty much for two extra tickets, when all we wanted was to get to Paris at a decent time; and to top it off, you state that if the price is higher at the time of the change, you have to pay the penalty PLUS the difference in fare, BUT if the new fare is lower, then NO  refund would be issued. I mean, regardless of your business reason for doing so, it really hurts to be out almost $100 to exchange a ticket for a different time on the same day for the same price. This is shameful!

As a result the boarder security assured us Eurostar would transfer the ticket. Boarder security took us to the Eurostar desk in which they stated they would transfer the ticket after ping ponging us between multiple staff members. They said they would transfer once the visa issue had been resolved first. The visa issue was rectified overnight as expected and upon returning the next day Eurostar staff refused to honour there word. The treatment and attitude from the desk was the worst I've ever experienced. With my wife in tears they forced us to pay for a new ticket forfeiting our old one. The initial ticket was around 100 pounds for 2 people one way. The man at the counter with a big smug smile requests 395 pound for the new tickets knowing we had no other choice as we'd already spent a fortune in lost accomodation and additional hotel for the night. Absolutely disgusting company. I contacted the Eurostar help online thinking they would be appalled by this staff members attitude and honour the initial agreement but no this company are scum all the way from the top to bottom.

Not only those idiots managed to replace old trains with newer ones that offer less comfort, less space and terrible design. Eurostar now has a new scam in place. If you arrive less than 30min before departure, say 28 minutes before the train as it's what happened to me today, they will charge \u00a330 to change your tickets. Obviously they charge for credit card fees on top. It used to be that they would offer some flexibility but they've now realised that their monopoly allowed them to just charge for whatever they pleased. The staff is untrained and odious. My 7-months pregnant wife could explain as much as she wanted that the reason for her 2-minutes tardiness was due to the fact that she was carrying a baby and she could not walk fast but that obviously did not matter. The waiting spaces are nasty and can only remain that way as no cleaning staff can be seen.  On top of that, their trains are most often late and sometimes from personal experience they will put you in the next train when they can't handle their check-in properly. Having no direct competitor, they obviously overcharge all their passengers as my roundtrip for two has now cost me close to \u00a3600. Overall I cannot really see any positive for this poorly managed enterprise. I just can't wait for a competitor to arrive.

The old slam door trains of British Rail days may have had their faults but generally they got to London Bridge faster than first franchise holder Notwork SouthCentral,  and very much quicker than the totally rubbish service offered by Southern.  Southern are just one big rip off company who con politicians and the travelling public with excessive fares and poor service, while their totally useless self-important managers stuff their pockets with commuters hard-earned cash and care nothing for customers.  They took over the franchise with glossy magazine slogans about 'The Renaissance of the Great British Railway' which soon turned out to be the sickest of jokes given their poor service and total lack of customer care.  They really havn't got the first idea of how to efficiently run a railway franchise and their trains on the Brighton line (and others) are now the most expensive, slowest and most unreliable in Europe - slower than the UK's golden age of steam. They have totally failed the travelling public and should be stripped of the franchise without delay.  I am so glad I sold up and moved away from Redhill as I couldn't stand their daily excuses any longer.  I can only advise long suffering commuters on Southern to take direct action to get rid of them;  to refuse to pay fares; to drive over to the nearest Southeastern network station and catch more reliable trains up to town; to car share to the nearest London tube;  and to keep doing it until the government listens (most unlikely)  or you manage to bankrupt the whole rotten company. Boycott them by campaigning for fast regular coach services, start community rail groups to get rid of them, but most of all stop buying their rip off season tickets.  They will soon start to listen when it hurts their fat pockets. Good luck to you all.

Was due to return on the 30.6.18 on the  4:12 from Paddington to Cardiff however because of your poorly trained and abusive staff I missed the train. The saga began with the platform being announced and on the departures board, where there was a massive surge of people running for the train and staff hurrying people along, I guess as it had gone 4:12 they were up against it and wanted the train out ASAP. My ticket would not go through the machine, I went to the male staff member on the gates, his badge said Stephen. He told me I did not have the correct ticket ?? and brushed me aside, I was panic stricken, my friends were already through and he would not help me. A female staff member looked at my ticket and let me through stating the ticket was fine?? However they would not let me on the train and it left. I was shocked and distraught. Stephen was laughing and mocking me as I returned to the gates. I did not think he was professional and told him so. The female staff member said I could get the next train. I asked for his name and he went ballistic, shouting at me and came through the gate right in my face shouting\" Stephen\" . I felt very intimidated and scared of him. He was very aggressive towards me. I left the area as he continued to shout at me and then justifying himself to the female staff member who was very quiet and stood with her head down. Very unhelpful situation, he needs training in how to deal with CUSTOMERS.. if he is on the frontline of your service you have a big problem. Stephen is lucky I made it home on time to be able to top up my insulin or he would have been looking at far worse charges. Out of principal the  next time I intend to travel I will use a bus company and factor in the time difference as part of my trip. Disgusting way to be treated when I paid enough for a service that I did not get. SHAMEFUL. BTW - your air conditioning is poor and staff announcements are a waste of time as they can't be heard.... I had to ask what the announcement was about  and was told that if I wanted refreshment I needed to get off the train at the next stop and go to the first 5 cars where there was refreshment trolley ????  Was it because \"the trolley\" doesn't fit throughout your trains or that they just couldn't be bothered to come through the cars???  again a poor service on what looked to me to be a relatively new train.

Was due to return on the 30.6.18 on the  4:12 from Paddington to Cardiff however because of your poorly trained and abusive staff I missed the train. The saga began with the platform being announced and on the departures board, where there was a massive surge of people running for the train and staff hurrying people along, I guess as it had gone 4:12 they were up against it and wanted the train out ASAP. My ticket would not go through the machine, I went to the male staff member on the gates, his badge said Stephen. He told me I did not have the correct ticket ?? and brushed me aside, I was panic stricken, my friends were already through and he would not help me. A female staff member looked at my ticket and let me through stating the ticket was fine?? However they would not let me on the train and it left. I was shocked and distraught. Stephen was laughing and mocking me as I returned to the gates. I did not think he was professional and told him so. The female staff member said I could get the next train. I asked for his name and he went ballistic, shouting at me and came through the gate right in my face shouting\" Stephen\" . I felt very intimidated and scared of him. He was very aggressive towards me. I left the area as he continued to shout at me and then justifying himself to the female staff member who was very quiet and stood with her head down. Very unhelpful situation, he needs training in how to deal with CUSTOMERS.. if he is on the frontline of your service you have a big problem. Stephen is lucky I made it home on time to be able to top up my insulin or he would have been looking at far worse charges. Out of principal the  next time I intend to travel I will use a bus company and factor in the time difference as part of my trip. Disgusting way to be treated when I paid enough for a service that I did not get. SHAMEFUL. BTW - your air conditioning is poor and staff announcements are a waste of time as they can't be heard.... I had to ask what the announcement was about  and was told that if I wanted refreshment I needed to get off the train at the next stop and go to the first 5 cars where there was refreshment trolley ????

Bear in mind that the highest fees in the world in terms of public transport are in UK, so why their service is worst than in the 3rd world and the government don't even bother to investigate this scam.", "url": "https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.southeasternrailway.co.uk", "stars": "star-rating star-rating-1 star-rating--medium"},

The staff are usually really good, if a bit exasperated (they do not complain, it is just they are often dealing with tricky circumstances); although, sad to say, one guard prompted a complaint for her dictatorial behaviour (guarding an empty First Class on an  overloaded train, the company seems to have changed policies since).  During the recent snow, I am afraid that they failed to provide security and nearly emptied out a train because the horn stopped working, but after 5 minutes of 250 passengers standing puzzled in the snow, they let them reboard and went at 20mph, which was the right thing to do.  Generally, the service is okay.  Sometimes, trains get delayed due to staff not getting to Victoria, there are too many delays but it is the exception rather than the rule.
